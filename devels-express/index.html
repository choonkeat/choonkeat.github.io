    <div class="entry-content"><p>I frequently meet budding entrepreneurs, people with ideas, looking for a technical co-founder, or someone to build them the thing they have in mind.</p>

<p>Sometimes, 6 months or a year later, they&#8217;d drop me a note, <em>&#8220;Hey remember X? I&#8217;ve finally found someone to build it! It&#8217;s still early, but can you look at it? I&#8217;d appreciate your feedback&#8221;</em> I&#8217;d click on the link or look at their source code&#8230;</p>

<p>And my heart sinks.</p>

<p>How much have you spent on this (first time developer?) freelancer&#8230; and ohh, the time. Wasted. One <em>year</em> wasted only to reach here.</p>

<p>This happens heart-breakingly often.</p>

<p>Though I may not have been sold on an idea, I still wish, a year ago, I had set them off with a decent running app that does the gist of things. <span class="pullquote">Good foundation, fully tested, deployed on the internet, in proper markup for future designers to extend, ready for their first users and iteration</span> - which I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d get to, these guys have the heart and the energy.</p>

<p>If only they&#8217;d have at least <em>that</em> to hustle with. A year ago.</p>

<h3>Well, let&#8217;s change that</h3>

<p>First, we must realize that Parkinson&#8217;s Law is very, very, very true. For everyone.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion&#8221;
- Parkinson&#8217;s Law</p></blockquote>

<p>If you&#8217;re still in the early stages, the gist of your idea can usually be done quickly. The more time you lend to it, the more you procrastinate, the more unfocused, airy fairy it gets, the less likely it ever gets built.</p>

<p>Bringing your idea into existence <em>quickly</em> helps you move beyond theory. Let real people experience it, and give real feedback. Then you iterate and improve on it quickly.</p>

<blockquote><p>That’s the reason shipping fast and frequently is so critical. Until your product or feature is out in the wild, being used by real users, you’re building in a tunnel of assumptions. You need empirical proof what you’re working on will pay off. And the only proof you’ll get is with usage.
- Josh Pigford, <a href="http://insideintercom.io/how-baremetrics-went-from-0-to-14000-per-month/">How Baremetrics went from $0 to $14,000 per month</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So with a hat-tip to the once popular but long defunct <a href="http://37signals.com/express_example">37express</a> offering&#8230;</p>

<h3>Introducing: Devels Express</h3>

<p>We will meet &amp; discuss your idea over coffee. We&#8217;ll agree on what a basic app of your idea would be like. I&#8217;ll build it and you&#8217;ll have it after <strong>1 week</strong>.</p>

<p><span class="pulled-quote">
  If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late
  &mdash; Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn
</span></p>

<p>Don&#8217;t waste time ding-donging. Give up the ability to worry and pixel push every page layout in this early stage &amp; you&#8217;ll get <em>your very own</em> product before next week - worth it? You <em>can</em> pixel push all you want with your designer <em>after the first version is done</em>. You can integrate with more services, prioritised according to real customer feedback, <em>after the first version is done</em>. You can streamline and improve the experience, <em>after the first version is done</em></p>

<p>After <strong>1 week</strong>, you&#8217;ll get a <a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec">fully tested</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> app, <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">on the web</a>, e.g. beta.yourapp.com. It will be in standard <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, clean, simple, usable and yet affords you <a href="http://themeforest.net/">maximum</a> design <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">flexibility</a>. Your future developer &amp; designer will be working to extend a solid code base we&#8217;ve built for you.</p>

<p><strong>1 week</strong> for <strong>$10,000</strong>.</p>
