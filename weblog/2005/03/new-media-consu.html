	<div class="entry-content"><p>Love and I missed our Oscars yesterday. Darn. Heard Edna Mode was there too. Darn! I really need a Tivo-thing soon.<br /><br />What&#8217;s with prime-time? (Yes I know, Oscars was repeated 10pm.. I wasn&#8217;t home then, kay?) I mean.. my prime time is roughly 11:30pm to 12:20pm.. and during my bus rides. What does broadcasting and programming ppl do for ppl like me? Or maybe big media companies like that are just interested in things like <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">most</span> people.. <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">popular</span> shows.. <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">best seller</span> books.. chart <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">toppers</span>.. <br /><br />What about <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html">The Long Tail</a>? (Do you know that the popular titles only account for less than half of Amazon&#8217;s sales? And the rest made up of from below the top 130,000 titles? Or to say in another way, if you&#8217;re only trying to sell the most popular things now - you can more than double your sales by selling the less popular too) I mean, I <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">would</span> watch more &#21556;&#23447;&#23466; only if you&#8217;ve had those shows for me at the time of my convenience.. its free-to-air TV anyways right? What&#8217;s wrong with providing me downloads? (Cue legal advise) <br /><br />I&#8217;ve called it a day with radio recently. Haven&#8217;t been listening. Maybe half because I don&#8217;t listen to music that much anyways. I do chase after morning shows, previously Glenn &amp; Rod on Perfect 10.. then Morning Express.. now, no more. Rod is out, so its officially become a snoozer - only good for traffic updates. Flying Dutchman is just too parent-y <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">nowadays</span> and can really get on my nerves. Love says he&#8217;s acting like that to balance off the younger 2 jokers. Then I think too bad for him&#8230; Oh I&#8217;ve side tracked. No, I don&#8217;t listen to radio anymore. I don&#8217;t suit their programming, timeslots and stuff and there&#8217;s nothing I can do about that. My time is apparently not their time. And there&#8217;s ain&#8217;t nothing nice to listen to for my ride home.<br /><br />Instead of waiting for big media companies to come suit my ever-changing (I admit) radio / tv tuning schedules and tastes (think I have better luck keeping on with my Win-Toto-Love-becomes-Taitai dream).. I listen to something that&#8217;s superbly accustom to my habits. When I work late, I hear my favourite shows late. When I work early, I hear my favourite shows early. Sometimes I prefer to read on the bus - but really I don&#8217;t want to have the feeling I&#8217;m missing out on something, not listening to those shows. Then when I do choose to listen, I can catch up all those 3, 4 shows and not miss a thing!<br /><br />Now that&#8217;s the way I want my media. My newspapers. My radio. My tv. <br /><br />My newspapers have been effectively replaced by <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/">RSS feeds</a> from various places (these news are newer, these news are only what I want: No lousy soccer soap opera, no classifieds to throw away). I look at a site, if its interesting and has RSS feeds [<a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=rss+xml+icon">example icons to lookout for</a>, <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/topblogs">example sites</a>], I subscribe to their feed (this is totally different from letting them send me newsletters: I don&#8217;t <a href="/articles/2005/01/30/helplessness-of-giving-your-email-info-no-more">devulge my emails</a> to them).. I read a few entries, and if I like I continue keeping them; If I don&#8217;t like, I take their feed off my <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/">RSS aggregator</a>. Simple. Pick and choose.. until you reach your <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">own</span> sweet spot. I read from about 50 feeds. mrbrown reads 100 - 300 - no shit!<br /><br />My radio has been replaced by <a href="http://ipodder.org/">podcasts</a> (<a href="http://dawnanddrew.com/">dawnanddrew </a>is really funny, think &quot;Glenn and Rod&quot; on steroids, and they&#8217;re the reason I&#8217;ve been silly smiling on the bus again. Mac fans can listen to <a href="http://www.macminute.com/2004/11/02/insidemac/">Inside Mac Radio</a>). I switch on my PC when I wake up, go brush my teeth and stuff, come back sync the <a href="http://www.ipodder.org/directory/4/ipodderSoftware">ipodder</a> downloads into mp3 player (i got a lousy one that can&#8217;t ffwd!) as I change.. shutdown and I&#8217;m on the road, loaded with fun stuff I can listen to on the road. And on my way home. Sweet.<br /><br />Now.. when I do get my TV done right, that&#8217;ll be the day.<br /><br /></p>
