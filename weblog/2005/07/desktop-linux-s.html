	<div class="entry-content"><p>I use Linux at work, at home, and had been Linux administrator for a couple of years. I love it, I really do. When someone says its no good, I feel like my child&#8217;s been told he&#8217;s ugly. I was even accused of being a Linux bigot.<br/>
<br/>
But I still don&#8217;t think Linux is ready for <span style="font-weight: bold;">mainstream</span> desktop usage. By mainstream, I mean adoption. Not technically ready or not. Adoption in the future? Yes (please!). Now? No. And so, I&#8217;m quite sad to see <a href="http://emergerandom.blogspot.com/2005/07/we-have-made-linux-ready-now-lets-make.html">this article</a> and what&#8217;s more surprising is that Dvorak <a href="http://www.dvorak.org/blog/?p=2350">recommended it</a> so highly:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><br />
&quot;This is hands down the best article I&rsquo;ve read in the past year.&quot;<br/>
</blockquote><br />
<br/>
Really? Now, I think I&#8217;m probably more sad that <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">that&#8217;s</span> the best article Linux desktop argument can go. <br/>
<br/>
I like the article&#8217;s observation that it is unfair for Linux that John-Doe-type users jumps to Linux without knowing anything only to leave with a disgusted experience. Good start. I can also agree to his comments on &quot;Filesystems, C:, D:, etc&quot; being a non-issue.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>But don&#8217;t be ridicolous tellimg me that typing &quot;emerge gaim&quot; is difficult, please. The fact the user has no training for typing &quot;emerge foo&quot; IS WRONG, not the package manager. Users need to learn, THEN to use the system. Would you click on an executable installer, if no one ever told you that&#8217;s the way to install software?<br />
</blockquote><br />
<br/>
<br/>
Yahh&#8230; but before I gathered my own thoughts properly, he moved on to describe how to deal with non-packaged applications&#8230; and compiling. That&#8217;s it. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, given a 2-lab-rat scenario I&#8217;d agree (almost, see next para). I would even argue that the lab-rat typing &quot;emerge foo&quot; will find it smoother to do. Usability.<br/>
<br/>
But gravity pulls down and Windows is double-click install. These are facts even lab tests should adhere to. The Linux way may be more elegant, manageable. But without a <span style="font-weight: bold;">bridge</span> from Windows-land it&#8217;ll not work. Assuming that new users has no background is really quite a stretch. Even the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chris_pratley/archive/2004/04/27/120944.aspx">then-new-comer Microsoft Excel had to bend to Lotus 123&#8217;s rules</a> before winning their market.<br />
 <i>[Update: I figure <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000052.html">this Joel article</a> is a better example.]</i><br />
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic;">But.. Linux has double-click installers too!</span> All of them? Most of them? Some this, some that&#8230; but that&#8217;s not a fault of Linux in itself - its a diverse, vibrant community - but when it comes to adoption and learnability, that&#8217;s a glaring hole. How do you tell a your restaurant customer, with a straight face, &quot;Tell the waitress your order she&#8217;ll bring to your table.. meat only. Veges you gotta get yourself from there - its free flow! Drinks are available from the vending machines outside. Hot drinks, we only have 3-in-1&#8230; yes everything is in the pantry you can make them yourself.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
One face. Macintosh has it. John Doe users switch to Macs doesn&#8217;t seem to have such hoohas. Even though Macs are different too. In fact they think different (corny). Filesystem&#8217;s different too. Heck, OS X is even a Unix! I used to think Redhat was the company to do it for Linux. But apparently they&#8217;re not interested in John Doe. Until Linux presents itself a single face (not necessarily only 1 company) and learn to play by the defacto rules (Windows)&#8230; Linux will remain supreme, but not for the mainstream desktop.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think I&#8217;m more sad that its the best punch Linux can pull off, than with the article&#8217;s content itself.<br/></p>
