	<div class="entry-content"><p>Its quite common to mis-position a new technology (e.g. <a href="http://educ.ubc.ca/courses/lled301/textbook/multimedia/timeline.html">paper</a> was first used for wrapping, only later for writing). Rails and Ajax could be one of them. <br /><br />
A wrong battle is being fought out there - and this one is probably as wrong as how we were once sold on an interactive technology called the Java Applet.<br /><br />
Some might scoff at Web2.0 attempts like <a href="http://www.writely.com/">Writely</a> to replace MS Word, or <a href="http://numsum.com/scratch/new">NumSum</a> replacing Excel. I believe its not about whether they can match feature for feature (they can&#8217;t) since good enough is often good enough, and people will be willing to settle for common features. But rather, its more against the idea of using a somewhere-out-there 3rd party tool - Hey, can I trust them with my confidential data? Also, I do need it tomorrow noon ya know? &quot;<span style="font-family: Courier New;">We&#8217;re currently down for maintenance</span>&quot; will be the last thing I want to see. Its the same distrust that some people still have, that they&#8217;d print out on paper even if when they own the softcopy: <span style="font-style: italic;">its somewhere-out-there in that harddisk, I&#8217;d rather file a physical copy in the cabinet</span>.<br /><br />
This generation think-gap can be bridged. If you can use Writely as a <span style="font-style: italic;">desktop</span> word processor, would you? Network connectivity is optional (for some online-payable services, watever), but not necessary. If its in my computer and I can use it as and when I like, what do I care if its actually &quot;browser-based&quot; or a &quot;native window&quot; application? When I click save, the file is saved in my folder, in my harddisk. Mine. Mine, mine, mine.<br /><br />
The good thing about deploying web technology on desktop is the recycling of skillset and technology - regardless of writing for desktop or the web, a developer would never have to leave his comfortable browser + database technologies. The same app can be hosted (newer generation: my data is always-on, yippie!) or run as plain-old Mac app, Windows app, or Unix app. OpenOffice, for example, uses <a href="http://hsqldb.org/">HSQLDB</a> as its storage so its not news that traditionally client-server technologies are finding their way to the desktop. Why bother with platform dependent widget libraries (gtk? qt? swt, swing, cocoa?) when there&#8217;s the omnipresent HTML + browser combo, readily available even in handhelds? Without a network roundtrip, the UI will be responsive. <span style="font-style: italic;">For a number of applications</span>, such a setting is probably good enough.<br /><br />
So, in such a desktop app, the underlying web platform would preferably be light-weight instead of scalable N-tiered. No kitchen sink Weblogic, sorry. Webrick or Lighty will do just fine. Served from flexible ports please, we don&#8217;t want to see port-already-in-use when its just me trying to edit my spreadsheet. No Oracle-the-overkill too, not even MySQL. Sqlite will suffice - something with no extra config, cross platform and doesn&#8217;t require a separate install. <br /><br />
Hence, regarding the &quot;wrong battle&quot;, the impact of Rails + Ajax might not be in the JEE or .Net realm after all. <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails&#8217;</a> strength is in providing a productive, consistent and simple platform. Ajax pursues to deliver <a href="http://www.backbase.com/">complex, responsive UI</a> via the browser. Riding on the re-ignition of browser technologies, the real playground, as the famous saying goes: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Its%20the%20desktop%2C%20stupid">Its the desktop, stupid</a>. <br /><br />
