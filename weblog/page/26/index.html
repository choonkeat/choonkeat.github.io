		<p>I&#8217;ve created an account (free, for 1 project) at <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> today. Perhaps it was the <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/03/10/basecamp.html">interview</a> that tipped me. </p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>&quot;&#8230; real-world projects don&#8217;t run like an organized, Gantt-charted project plan. Real projects are chaotic: missed deadlines, miscommunication, scope creep, new initiatives, new people in, old people out. There&#8217;s a lot of stuff to be said, but nowhere to say it, store it, and organize it. That&#8217;s where Basecamp comes in&#8230;&quot;</p></blockquote><p>How true. These people appear to face what I&#8217;m facing (I don&#8217;t suck after all!).. Perhaps they, with this understanding, could be The One to give me something that addresses my issues with (project) management. Or perhaps its just that I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://tadalist.com/">Ta-da</a> quite a lot and am just waiting for the reason to try the full product.</p><p>Anyways, so far so good. I&#8217;m liking what I see and can imagine how it melds into my daily routines. Goodbye, Yahoo Calendar - the dinosaur I irk to use because there&#8217;s nothing else. (Wonder if Basecamp can feature repeatable events.. that&#8217;ll be complete)</p><p>However, I&#8217;m pretty surprised  - considering their close affiliation - there&#8217;s nothing about Tada in Basecamp. What&#8217;s for a user whom have learnt to appreciate the Ta-da way, created a few lists of many many items.. to switch to Basecamp? For now, looks like I have to import them myself - 1 by 1.. I mean, hey even <a href="http://multiply.com/">Multiply</a> has a module to import from a competitor, <a href="http://www.friendster.com/">Friendster</a>.</p><p>&quot;Convert to Free Basecamp account&quot; link in Ta-da would be kewl. Click and I have my (new or existing) Basecamp account plus all my Ta-da lists intact. Painless upgrade.</p><p>Until then, I&#8217;ll be slowly shifting my 6 lists and 40+ todos.. or live with checking 2 different sites (irk)</p><p>PS: Also, how about adding <font face="courier new,courier,monospace">link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; title=&quot;RSS&quot; href=&quot;&#8230;&quot;</font> <link title="RSS" href="..." type="application/rss+xml" rel="alternate" />somewhere in the header of pages so that the cute, cute orange Subscribe icon can appear at my Firefox bottom-right? In any case, it&#8217;ll be good <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/global/English/uibook/chapters/5.html">consistency</a>. :-) <br /></p>

I have yet to hear a convincing case against this design, so I&#8217;m soliciting for one here   if any. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ll need to do a Graphical Editor application allowing users to do some doodle drawing or whatever, and let them save their art as a file   an XML file.

<p><br /><strong>The Analysis</strong><br /><br /><strong>Method#4:</strong> You don&#8217;t have to be an expert and will be able to tell by the strike-out that Method #4 seems most straight-forward. The only thing is, Step5 (manipulate the DOM) directly in your interface layer just won&#8217;t cut. That&#8217;ll be doing classic <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">XML situps</a>. So this is out - unless your editor requires blazing speeeeeed.</p><p><strong>Method#1:</strong> This seem the most common that I&#8217;ve seen. On the hindsight, its surprising to be common. The bad about this design is that values are copied to-and-fro the XML itself. This poses some problems in flexibility in development. You&#8217;ll need to have <strong>ALL</strong> of the Model classes written and working properly before you can even open-edit-save your first document (Step#7 collects all fragments into 1 XML, missing models == missing fragments == invalid XML). </p><p>If you&#8217;re writing your own Microsoft Word editor (<a href="http://rep.oio.dk/Microsoft.com/officeschemas/welcome.htm">WordML-based</a>), nobody can ever open-edit-save their Word document until you&#8217;ve 100% finished with your code - if they try before you&#8217;ve done that Model class for less-common features like &quot;themes&quot;.. they&#8217;ll get rubbish XML file that Microsoft Word can&#8217;t open anymore. Your XML file isn&#8217;t correct. Misses out on an attribute. Misses out on that Element. Render their data to trash - what&#8217;s a worse nightmare for beta testers? So you say, To Hell with the testers! &quot;<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000036.html">and we&#8217;ll ship when we&#8217;re good and ready</a>&quot; ! This ultimately mean: no early feedback, no rapid application design, no iterative releases, no early adopters, no extreme programming. ZIP.</p><p>Don&#8217;t care about those things? Say after 3 months and you&#8217;d sold a million copies. You think about adding this spiffy feature to blink text will sell another million. You change the XML format of your document, update your Model classes and releases V1.1. Will everyone upgrade? No. Tom uses V1.1 creates blinky text, saves, sends to friend with V1.0, opens no blinky text, edits typo, saves, sends back to Tom, open, no more blinky text. Tom asks you &quot;WTF?&quot;</p><p>For a moment, drop all arguments of &quot;other people&#8217;s application also like that&quot; and listen to me: If you can get Tom to see his blinky text - for negligible development effort - why not? Now bring back your &quot;other people&quot; argument - you now have an application that handles backward compatibility like non-other. So if you agree with me that Method#1 is A Bad Thing (yes, you agree), we&#8217;ll proceed with alternatives..</p><p><strong>Method #2:</strong> To solve the bad of Method #1 (losing unimplemented data), we can keep the original document intact. Upon saving the models objects copy their values back to the DOM and the DOM saves itself. Only the modified portions are modified and everyone is happy. Yay! Yay? No. The only reason anyone would do this, is because they <em>feel</em> too much work has been done using Method #1, they&#8217;ve realised the bad too late and this is simply a work-around.</p><p><strong>Method #3:</strong> The models in this design doesn&#8217;t hold the values at all. When you getXXX() or setXXX(), the Model objects locate the precise spot in the DOM (using Xpath) and get or set <strong>the values in the DOM directly</strong>. So it doesn&#8217;t suffer from the bad of Method #1. Your model objects are now just Proxies, or Helpers. You&#8217;ll only need 1 x XPath-based super class to do your XML sit-ups (trust me, with XPath.. XML ain&#8217;t situps), creating the individual Models subsequently are just a matter of defining the relative paths (String) in each Model. There isn&#8217;t any XML to do after the super-class.</p><p>Models performing XPath at runtime to get/set values too slow? You can always implement some form of caching there. Remember, writing the models are just specifying strings of paths. No more XML loops, nodes, get text element, hasAttribute.. all these are done by XPath engine and your base class. Development time hastens, users can open-edit-save using your application once you have some of the Models done. If you&#8217;d complete the common Models required by your users, they&#8217;ll be happily using your app whilst you slowly finish off with those unless-but-there features.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br /><br />So, amuse me. Why not Method #3. </p><p>PS: Don&#8217;t give me edge what-if-scenarios and say Method #3 can&#8217;t handle this - Heck! I never said its silver bullet - if other methods can&#8217;t handle them too, drop it.<br /></p></p>

		<p>Co-Surfing. Quite interesting.. a more interactive extension to 3rd Voice (if any of you still remembers.. it was year 2000..)<br /><br />This company Jybe has done a toolbar for both IE and Firefox (Yay!) unfortunately requires lousy Internet-v1.0-style registration and newsletters checkboxes and blah.<br /><br />Anyways, was looking for a demo before installing. No luck. So decided to do my own. Check it out here: <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/_doc/Jybe_Review.htm">Jybe Demo</a> [swf, dis-coloring due to optimized swf filesize..], and see if you like it - for business use (e.g. real-time website design approval with clients) or personal use (e.g. can&#8217;t think of yet)<br /><br />I think it&#8217;ll be better if participants don&#8217;t have to &quot;join&quot; a session like now. Its a learning/adoption hurdle. A better interface than &quot;click join &gt; enter <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">name</span> &gt; enter <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">channel</span>&quot;.. is a special URL I can easily pass to another person - &quot;Hey check this out, http://&#8230;.. &quot; - for he/she to click on, and immediately we&#8217;re co-surfing (assuming toolbar installed on both parties). Of cos, &quot;assuming toolbar installed&quot; is a hurdle itself, but that&#8217;s deployment issue.<br /><br />And knowing that our browsing is going through a 3rd party server is quite sucky, especially for <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">business</span> use. While we&#8217;re at installing toolbars already, I don&#8217;t see why we can&#8217;t take a step towards P2P.</p>

		<p>Love and I missed our Oscars yesterday. Darn. Heard Edna Mode was there too. Darn! I really need a Tivo-thing soon.<br /><br />What&#8217;s with prime-time? (Yes I know, Oscars was repeated 10pm.. I wasn&#8217;t home then, kay?) I mean.. my prime time is roughly 11:30pm to 12:20pm.. and during my bus rides. What does broadcasting and programming ppl do for ppl like me? Or maybe big media companies like that are just interested in things like <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">most</span> people.. <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">popular</span> shows.. <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">best seller</span> books.. chart <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">toppers</span>.. <br /><br />What about <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html">The Long Tail</a>? (Do you know that the popular titles only account for less than half of Amazon&#8217;s sales? And the rest made up of from below the top 130,000 titles? Or to say in another way, if you&#8217;re only trying to sell the most popular things now - you can more than double your sales by selling the less popular too) I mean, I <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">would</span> watch more &#21556;&#23447;&#23466; only if you&#8217;ve had those shows for me at the time of my convenience.. its free-to-air TV anyways right? What&#8217;s wrong with providing me downloads? (Cue legal advise) <br /><br />I&#8217;ve called it a day with radio recently. Haven&#8217;t been listening. Maybe half because I don&#8217;t listen to music that much anyways. I do chase after morning shows, previously Glenn &amp; Rod on Perfect 10.. then Morning Express.. now, no more. Rod is out, so its officially become a snoozer - only good for traffic updates. Flying Dutchman is just too parent-y <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">nowadays</span> and can really get on my nerves. Love says he&#8217;s acting like that to balance off the younger 2 jokers. Then I think too bad for him&#8230; Oh I&#8217;ve side tracked. No, I don&#8217;t listen to radio anymore. I don&#8217;t suit their programming, timeslots and stuff and there&#8217;s nothing I can do about that. My time is apparently not their time. And there&#8217;s ain&#8217;t nothing nice to listen to for my ride home.<br /><br />Instead of waiting for big media companies to come suit my ever-changing (I admit) radio / tv tuning schedules and tastes (think I have better luck keeping on with my Win-Toto-Love-becomes-Taitai dream).. I listen to something that&#8217;s superbly accustom to my habits. When I work late, I hear my favourite shows late. When I work early, I hear my favourite shows early. Sometimes I prefer to read on the bus - but really I don&#8217;t want to have the feeling I&#8217;m missing out on something, not listening to those shows. Then when I do choose to listen, I can catch up all those 3, 4 shows and not miss a thing!<br /><br />Now that&#8217;s the way I want my media. My newspapers. My radio. My tv. <br /><br />My newspapers have been effectively replaced by <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/">RSS feeds</a> from various places (these news are newer, these news are only what I want: No lousy soccer soap opera, no classifieds to throw away). I look at a site, if its interesting and has RSS feeds [<a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=rss+xml+icon">example icons to lookout for</a>, <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/topblogs">example sites</a>], I subscribe to their feed (this is totally different from letting them send me newsletters: I don&#8217;t <a href="/articles/2005/01/30/helplessness-of-giving-your-email-info-no-more">devulge my emails</a> to them).. I read a few entries, and if I like I continue keeping them; If I don&#8217;t like, I take their feed off my <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/">RSS aggregator</a>. Simple. Pick and choose.. until you reach your <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">own</span> sweet spot. I read from about 50 feeds. mrbrown reads 100 - 300 - no shit!<br /><br />My radio has been replaced by <a href="http://ipodder.org/">podcasts</a> (<a href="http://dawnanddrew.com/">dawnanddrew </a>is really funny, think &quot;Glenn and Rod&quot; on steroids, and they&#8217;re the reason I&#8217;ve been silly smiling on the bus again. Mac fans can listen to <a href="http://www.macminute.com/2004/11/02/insidemac/">Inside Mac Radio</a>). I switch on my PC when I wake up, go brush my teeth and stuff, come back sync the <a href="http://www.ipodder.org/directory/4/ipodderSoftware">ipodder</a> downloads into mp3 player (i got a lousy one that can&#8217;t ffwd!) as I change.. shutdown and I&#8217;m on the road, loaded with fun stuff I can listen to on the road. And on my way home. Sweet.<br /><br />Now.. when I do get my TV done right, that&#8217;ll be the day.<br /><br /></p>
