		<p>  <p>Keep up to date through out the day? Have a 1-look overview of all updates? Pick 1. That&#8217;s what &quot;email digests&quot; means. You get to read only 1 single email containing all the updates - BUT you only get them at the end of the day. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/19/feedburner-will-dominate-blog-to-email/">That may suit some people</a>, but not me.<br />  </p>   <p>So RssFwd has a new feature today. Introducing a clustered view that allow readers to have the best of both worlds! With the help from Gmail of course (and any other e-mail program that has grown up to implement threading intelligently). To enable, just tick the &quot;clustered&quot; option at preview page.<br /></p>   <p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/choonkeat/138799309/"><img width="500" height="116" border="0" alt="RssFwd messages clustered in Gmail" src="http://static.flickr.com/48/138799309_8b415decd1.jpg" /></a></p>   <p>You get the benefit of keeping up to date wheneva you want to - the individual updates just keeps flowing in as individual emails. Additionally, you get the benefit of a reading everything on a single page when you choose to (end of day, start of day, end of week,&#8230; your pick!) </p> <p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/choonkeat/138816194/"><img width="233" height="500" border="0" alt="RssFwd messages clustered in Gmail (inside)" src="http://static.flickr.com/56/138816194_a691e92c70.jpg" /></a></p>   <p>RssFwd is attempting to de-throne <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/">Google&#8217;s own</a>, /cackle, and be the defacto RSS reader on Gmail. Hm, then again.. Google Reader was never meant to integrate with Gmail was it?<br />  </p></p>

		<p>Web Developer&#8217;s Quiz: Your website needs to somehow <strong><em>know</em></strong> what are the other websites a user had already visited. How do you do it? How do you get the information from a browser history?<br /></p><p><a href="http://www.feedblog.org/">Kevin Burton</a> pulled it off with a neat trick. When the new features of his Tailrank were <a href="http://www.feedblog.org/2006/03/tailrank_launch.html">released</a>. I must&#8217;ve been sleeping or busy, anyways, didn&#8217;t check out the improvements in Tailrank till now.</p><p>Under &quot;<a href="http://tailrank.com/import">import</a>&quot;, a user usually uploads his OPML file (which I&#8217;d <a href="../../articles/2006/02/21/tailrank-personalised-google-news-for-blogs">previously talked about</a>), input some URLs, etc. In his attempt to make Tailrank&#8217;s import applicable to more layman users, Kevin has a new &quot;Auto Configure&quot; button. Click on it, and a list of popular sites (that you&nbsp; have visited) are found and is ready for import. Damn, how did it know! </p><p>I did some view-source hunting and found <a href="http://www.faqts.com/knowledge_base/view.phtml/aid/7157">document.defaultView.getComputedStyle</a> and <a href="http://www.thescripts.com/forum/thread89231.html">element.currentStyle</a>. Explain: Given that your browser will style visited links differently from link not yet visited, Kevin merely printed a bunch of hidden links and used a javascript to pick out those you have visited! Woot! I can sure find some use for that&#8230; hmm.. can&#8217;t think of any now, but I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;re uses!<br /></p><p>That said, I would&#8217;ve preferred if Tailrank actually gave me the option to uncheck some of them from my list (especially since removal of feeds isn&#8217;t implemented yet)<br /></p>

		<p>I&#8217;m <em>still</em> not going to respond to <a href="http://duckdown.blogspot.com/2006/03/additional-thoughts-on-why-ruby-isnt.html">the complete (longish) article</a>.<br /> <br /> First, some agreements,<br /> <blockquote>Ruby is going down a path of creating their own Virtual Machine. It seems to me, that they should simply put Ruby on the Java VM and not waste efforts in reinventing the wheel<br /> </blockquote> VM. Sure. Whatever good stuff that comes. What&#8217;s for keeps is the Ruby <strong>language</strong>. <a href="http://smallthought.com/blog/">Avi Bryant</a> had even <a href="http://paranode.com/~topfunky/audio/2005/Avi-Bryant.mp3">contemplated</a> [mp3] that its highly possible having Smalltalk VM (more mature) running Ruby code. Heck, why not?<br /> <blockquote>Ruby needs to address multilingualization quickly<br /> </blockquote> i18n. Definitely. Don&#8217;t be so sure it ain&#8217;t coming or nearing. Anyways my 2 cents is, I haven&#8217;t seen any i18n done right (read: development phase). Runtime support for i18n is mature, and that&#8217;s the easy part.<br /> <br /> Now the negatives, <br /> <blockquote>Ruby seems to be missing something that is otherwise fundamental in other languages which is support for Regular Expressions<br /> </blockquote> Holy cow! Missing <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ruby%20regular%20expression">regular expressions in Ruby</a>? That&#8217;s funny. Firstly, its a common complain that Ruby inherited lots of stuff (good and bad) from Perl, guess what&#8217;s included? My other 2 cents says that Java happens to have the worst regex support. Of cos, I&#8217;m talking about syntax.<br /> <blockquote>I also couldn&#8217;t find the equivalent of instance variables. Wouldn&#8217;t that make reuse at an enterprise-level somewhat problematic?</blockquote><blockquote>Shouldn&#8217;t the notion of methods being public, private and protected also be a part of every modern language?&nbsp;</blockquote> Missing instance variable? Notion of public, private and protected methods? Boy, this guy needs to sit down with Bruce Eckel (Nothing against Bruce, just thought its a funny <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=146091">de ja vu</a>) Or more accurately, sit down with Ryan Davis.<br /></p>

People, then process then tools in that order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>Now that&#8217;s quite the priority that you&#8217;d want to be seen as believing in, ain&#8217;t it? He&#8217;s championing for Enterprise Architecture, so I must guess he means to say that&#8217;s the priority enterprises practise.</p><p>Interesting. </p><p>From the planet that I live in, outsourcing trends is on the rise and expensive software are sold to (and bought by) enterprises. Enterprise software&nbsp; projects are usually built with a <em>few good men</em> as leads, and a farm of programmers. Why outsource your first priority? If something is of last priority, why buy the most expensive? Hence, <strong>say it like it is</strong>, the following priority may reflect what&#8217;s out there: Tools and Process, <strong>then </strong>People.</p><p>And maybe, if one day&#8230; &quot;people&quot; does get prioritized higher&#8230; they&#8217;d be allowed to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">pick their own tools</a>.<br /></p>
