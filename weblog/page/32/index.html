		<p> When I first saw a wiki, I was awed by its concept: 1-script == complete website, editable by anyone browsing? <span style="font-style: italic;">That&#8217;s soooo</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">kewl</span>! <br /><br />One thing though, for me, is how easily a wiki site gets out of control. A link, a page, another link, another page and since wiki manages the links without regards for hierachies.. it takes on the properties more like a mindmap and becomes a mess of data, with creepy crawlies lying in many dark corners. When my wiki becomes a monster, I get turned off and start afresh.. loop. I still use wikis, only these days I use <a href="http://www.instiki.org/">Instiki</a> and for specific and limited purposes only. <br /> <br /> There&#8217;s another mess is waiting for me. Java frameworks. <br /><br />Struts, Tapestery, Maven, Spindle, Tacos, Spring, Hibernate,&#8230; e.g. Just look at the <a href="http://apache.org/">projects and sub-projects</a> here. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love the Apache Foundation. But, though an abalone is a delicacy.. too much will still make you puke. All these overlapping, 75%-alike, distant-cousins frameworks just makes my head spin. Perhaps dictatorship, e.g. Linux, .Net, is still the best way. <br /> <br /> The blessed <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000254.html">birth</a> of <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> is in that the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby community</a> now has only 1 hero to look for.<br /> <br /> Whereas in Java-land, the best thing to do now is to pick those projects (that suits ur needs) with the most momentum and ignore the rest. Reinventing the wheel? I&#8217;d rather risk that, than to read through every new wheel.<br /><br /></p>

		<p> Back in 2000/2001.. floods of dotcoms were pushing out CMS systems into everybody else&#8217;s face, and co-incidentally everybody else was looking for a CMS for their spanking new websites.<br /><br />The company I was in even went as far as driving prices right down to 2000 RM (we were targeting M&#8217;sian market) per CMS powered website - First, capture the market share! Then, fleece them! Our intern-turn-full-time programmer was churning out a website every 3 days! Not too-complex sites of cos, but nevertheless it wasn&#8217;t something I&#8217;d like to witness ever again - a programmer is no Shanghai assembly-line worker.<br /><br />Anyways, during the era where &quot;Content Is King&quot;, there is a common lack of good WYSIWYG editors usable by the average Joe customer. FrontPage? IE? Developers don&#8217;t like no evil IE-only COM object embed in HTMLs - besides that COM object was doing more things wrong than right. And there&#8217;s little you can do about it!<br /><br />So, lame excuses has to be conjured to make a plain old <span style="font-weight: bold;">textarea</span> input more platable for the average joe who wants their website to look like CNN. <br /><br />Fast forward 2003/2004.. I think Frederico (aka FredCK) saw that need and finally did a <a href="http://www.fckeditor.net/Demo/">super cross-browser WYSIWYG editor</a> - for <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php">FREE</a>. Yes, even commercial products can use it.<br /><br />I&#8217;d actually seen it few months back and was quite impressed already. However, only last night did I started appying it to my just-for-fun forum</a>.. now I&#8217;m REALLY impressed at the ease of deployment. I&#8217;d <span style="font-weight: bold;">only added </span>a javascript snippet onto the page - <span style="font-weight: bold;">without changing anything else</span> - and I get a WYSIWYG editor in replacement of my original textarea. Kewl, I thought. But does it <span style="font-style: italic;">work</span>? Do I have to jump hoops in my forum (programming) code? [Memories of dealing with the IE COM object suggested that I had to purposely code with the editor in mind, I could be wrong or inexperience then]<br /><br />I clicked the submit button. It works. No code changes. I only need to add the same javascript to every page that I want the textarea converted to a HTML editor. <br /><br />How much simpler can you get?<br /><br /></p>

		<p>After many weeks, I&#8217;d at last picked up my lazy ass to slap on a drag-and-drop interface to <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/jupload/">J&#8217;upload</a> and come up with a <a href="http://yanime.org/jupload/">working demo</a> [any uploaded file will go nowhere].<br /><br />Unfortunately, what was achievable fell short of my expectation. The naive goal was to create a firefox plugin that<br /><ol><li>Looks out for any &lt;input type=file&gt; tag (any file upload field) in any form rendered<br /></li><li>Re-render the field to use the applet (already installed with the plugin)</li><li>A drag-and-dropped filename will be prefilled into the browse field for the user<br /></li><li>The user can thus drag-and-drop files instead of clicking on the &#8216;browse&#8217; button, whenever he encounters a upload button<br /></li></ol>However, step #3 (using javascript to set the value of a filename) is apparently a severe breach of security and is not allowed on any sane browser. So, unless there&#8217;s another way around.. this plugin will not happen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

		<p> Everyone loves to create. To build. I&#8217;m sure its as valid in the construction industry as in software. The joy of the chase, towards making of a useful thing. Nobody likes maintenance because cleaning up is a shit-job.<br /><br />Between the two.. that&#8217;s where you get people with the most envious job scope - Abstract Artists. Create, never finished, not supposed to maintain.<br /><br />At the start of a project, the programmer is only a commodity - any Tom, Dick, or Harry (no offence!) starts with a clean slate, armed with the default weapons (of Java/.Net/Perl/whatever programming skills). However, he is a willing worker because his job is to create.<br /><br />After a while, the programmer has gathered project-specific knowledge that isn&#8217;t documented or even document-able. His value subtly increases day by day, meeting after meeting, as he bangs on his keyboard churning out his KLOCs.<br /><br />As the project nears its end point - the testing and trial phase - testers and users requests for change, change, change.. &quot;Change! Maintenance!&quot; irks the programmer. But this is when the project values him most - experience to gauge the feasibility of each change request, understand the implicit changes required, raise dependency warnings. But, his mind has been lost. The programmer has no more interested in making that textbox larger, the list box sort in another way, add a new field for input, blah blah blah.. It is a shit job now.<br /><br />Finance department, however, loves the supposed shit-job phase because changes potentially means money. The user has invested and has the shorter end of the stick to bargain. Who else are they going to turn to implement a change? Surely nobody else can do it more cost-effective that the current team!<br /><br />But to keep the programmer in the same project and milking the client for all they&#8217;re worth will be a sure way of driving the programmer to leave the company. On the other hand, taking him out of the project would mean change requests can only be done in a less cost effective that it <span style="font-style: italic;">could&#8217;ve</span>. Profit margin suffer.<br /><br />Is there a ever a win-win between the suits and the sneakers?  <br /><img src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:1blQFB0JUlkJ:www.whom.co.uk/whom/dilbert.jpg" /><br /><br /><br /> I&#8217;d a brief discussion with my poor been-in-project-for-too-long friend. We were discussing how a person&#8217;s mindset can be / should be changed in order to maintain a good post-project morale. And since Warcraft, MMORPGs are so very popular now.. we wondered why can&#8217;t corporates use the stickiness of MMORPG and apply to the HR dept.<br /><br />&quot;Golds&quot; <br /><br />In RPG your avatar has a life and his own worth. He has riches. Some games gives such real and tangible sense of value that players will indeed spend real money to purchase virtual items.<br /><br />I&#8217;m not suggesting companies start putting up virtual-stores and sell make-believe items to the employees. But rather, implement a system whereby riches can be distributed to the employees in forms of company golds. Much like the golds your avatar possess in the game.. or more closely, like CPF in the real world. The money (dollar for dollar) is yours but you can&#8217;t have them liquidated. You can only purchase things with it - anything.<br /><br />When you decide to quit the game (forever), your character is deleted and all the wealth and value is gone. When you leave the company, all is void. Sounds like stock options? No. Stock options is wait-and-see. Gold is use-it-now. <br /><br />Being able to think of crazy things is a blessing. <br /></p>

		<p>I guess JUnit (or <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span>Unit) can learn a thing or two from <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=7776">ZenTest</a> - guiding the programmer to unit test. <br /><br />Having a good unit test framework ain&#8217;t enough. If the lazy coder ain&#8217;t picking up &#8216;a new skill&#8217;.. he ain&#8217;t ever going to write that unit test - properly. ZenTest doesn&#8217;t stop there. It <span style="font-weight: bold;">works with the programmer&#8217;s existing code</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">guides</span> the programmer to <span style="font-weight: bold;">build up</span> the unit tests.<br /><br />That&#8217;s what a good framework should be aye? Not to stop at the libraries.. but find ways to gel into the user&#8217;s (user of the framework) workflow. Same goes for application framework / platform / middleware. If it only stops at the technical prowers and available, passive libraries without taking the step to conjure a &#8216;best-practice use&#8217; of itself.. then it will only be as good as a dustbin touting &quot;Please Use Me&quot;.. as compared to a recycle bin with a &quot;Throw Aluminium Cans Here&quot; sign.<br /><br /><br /></p>

I like that. <br /><br />Yes, the open-source advocate / proprietary-closed-source-is-bad in me actually likes the (if u wanna phrase it this way) LACK of freedom. Especially when &quot;the way&quot; has been well thought out indeed. Less is more. Less decisions required.

		<p> It was kinda surreal watching my TV booting up. To be correct, my TV was showing the xbox (grudgingly?) booting up.<br /> <br /> The original intent was to try <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54192&package_id=57509">Xebian</a> (debian good, apt-get better!).. however probably something was wrong with the CDR (was I supposed to use CDRW?) even though many people said I&#8217;m lucky to have a Samsung drive on my crystal set&#8230; anyhoo.. went around looking for a &#8216;network installable&#8217; Xbox Linux instead.. and ended up with.. <br /> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=248333">Gentoox</a>. By following a <a href="http://www.xbox-scene.com/articles/gentoo-share-drive.php">HOWTO article</a>, I managed to boot&#8217;em up. <br /> <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /> Installation review/feedback</span>: I&#8217;d initially thought my FTP screwed me up when it gave delirious error messages of &quot;Too many retries&quot; after I&#8217;d ftp&#8217;d over 3GB of files into my living room.. to make the panic panicker, the Gentoo menu on Evox just didn&#8217;t work as advertised - it hung when its supposed to boot linux in &#8216;less than 30 seconds.. &#8216;. However, prior to booting into EvoX, my <a href="http://www.smartxx.com/">mod</a> came with a &quot;boot linux from HDA&quot; option.. and that worked. It was then on the console that I saw the network startup had failed (that&#8217;s why the hang?). Luckily, I have a USB converter (soldered by my good friend, gnay) + USB keyboard.. managed to rectify the config and get it online. <br /><br />[update: you may wish to try making ur home network to be DHCP when booting up Gentoox for the first time, since its preconfigured as DHCP.. so u can ssh in an change later..]<br /> </div> <br /> I should give Gentoox a go for a while and learn the Gentoo distro.. however, trying to go back to the apt-get world is just so tempting.. [xbox is still fetching those gentoo thingies.. takes so long!]<br /> <br /> TODOs:<br />1. Convince Love that she&#8217;s not an xbox widow (politically correct to place this #1&#8230; )<br /> 2. Rearrange my network topo instead of dragging a 15m network cable [hazard!] into my living room.<br /> 3. Change to a bigger harddisk (<a href="http://www.xbox-scene.com/articles/hdd-ftp.php">Sounds quite safe</a> to DIY) since I only have 1.6GB free for games now. :-(<br /><br /></p>
