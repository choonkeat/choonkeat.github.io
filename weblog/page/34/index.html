		<p>Was chatting with my friend the other day.. and he complained that there&#8217;s no easy to use drag-drop capability in web technology.. well, you can with a signed applet - apparently <a href="http://www.radinks.com/upload/applet.php">some other company</a> already has a working product that does that.. just that its very ugly and cost money.<br /><br />Hence, I shall embark on yet-another &quot;because there should be better&quot; journey.. and do something like that, open sourced. Maybe a addon to <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/jupload/">J&#8217;upload</a> so as to minimize the wheel-reinvented. Let me know if anyone&#8217;s interested to do the shit work.<br /><br />The motto of the applet will be.. &quot;<i>Uploading, the way it should&#8217;ve been since day-1</i>&quot; (So, maybe its name is UTWISBSD1) Its aim.. so highly configurable, it should outright replace the icky &quot;Browse&quot; button.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /></p>

		<p> I&#8217;d often dreamed about how programmers could simply do &quot;fetch-data, output toXML()&quot; in their code, leaving designers to XSL-rise the output into HTML/WML etc&#8230; only to sigh at the Designer&#8217;s response of &quot;Huh? Simi-LT? Dunno la.. I&#8217;ll give you the files once I&#8217;m done with my DreamWeaver&quot;<br /><br />Apparently <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5123">someone else has that dream</a> too. However, he&#8217;s moved a step closer to possible broader acceptance.. requesting only to &quot;output toHTML()&quot;.. and requesting designers to use CSS stylesheet modifications only. He says &quot;<i>NO layout, NO colors, NO fonts, just data&#8230;.</i>&quot;<br /><br />Now, that&#8217;s very much possible - not just technically (the first scenario is also technically possible) - and palatable too.<br /><br /><utopian mode="on"><br />However, I hope to suggest a step for the programmer.. to add the &quot;style=&quot; attribute (since we&#8217;re at HTML) because only programmers know the <b>meaning</b> of data, designer&#8217;s don&#8217;t. It is thus a programmer&#8217;s job to provide that piece of information, which will make an impact to how the data looks like.<br /><br />It could even be embedded into the toXML/toHTML code of the data objects - to make a programmer&#8217;s life easy.. after which.. the only problem is really educating the designers not to drag the table width (Doh!), but to only change the CSS&#8230; Or perhaps, to reduce the indirection, Dreamweaver-alike applications can be modified/plugin-able to do stylesheet-only changes based on GUI events? Dragging tables? I&#8217;ll change its CSS.. the table remains only minimally </utopian><br /><br />I love new technologies / processes that people can glide into smoothly. That&#8217;s what I call, a technological advancement.<br /><br /><br /> <table style=""> </table></p>

		<p> <p>The Gmail hype is really incredible.. scarcity and all.. spent a while cracking my head on who to give my precious invites to&#8230; and when I&#8217;m finally done.. I get 5 more? Duh? A bug or something? 5 more? Now that I&#8217;d managed to convince myself why all my other friends don&#8217;t deserve to be invited.. how am I expected to rebuke my own rationale?<br /><br />I feel I&#8217;m suckered into some Multi-Level-Marketing thingy ;-)</p><p>Disclaimer: I&#8217;m not complaining about my <a href="http://www.google.com/">bestest friend</a>&#8230; just poking fun.<br /></p> <p>Anyways.. looks like i&#8217;m not that far off when I start to wonder to myself if <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5067">this is the way</a> they&#8217;re going to operate / roll out.. In fact, such viral technique might just be the most effective way of circumventing spammers from auto-subscribing free email accounts and start sending spams. Forget &quot;high-tech&quot; human-verification methods of using images as letters (seen an article about how porn industries are defeating such algorithms, links anyone?)&#8230; if your invitee spams, you&#8217;re out! or something like that&#8230; thus.. keeping the email accounts clean. Btw, orkut, a google-affiliated site already grows by <a href="http://www.orkut.com/join.html">such means</a>.<br /></p><p>Going a step further, a &#8216;credit alarm&#8217; might even be raised should other users start to mark a certain account holder&#8217;s emails as spam.. peer appraisal thingy.. </p><p>Anyways.. just waiting for GIM.. (Google Instant Messenger).. and this time, i&#8217;m sure won&#8217;t mind those ads.</p></p>

		<p> Fiddling with bugzilla just now.. and was contemplating on creating a button for our QA team to click on (instead of going to Bugzilla&#8217;s enter bug directly)<br /><br />This button will trigger a process to<br /><br /><ol><li>Place a unique stamp on log</li><li>Generates a URL (to view the log at the stamp, and -500 lines before it)</li><li>Redirects to bugzilla&#8217;s enter new bug page, with the URL pre-filled into the bug description field.</li></ol>Kewl.. this would be awfully useful to the developer receiving the bug.. Rather than trying to replicate the error and looking at the logs he&#8217;d <i>generated </i>for answers.. the developer might as well visit the log of the <i>original </i>incident directly..<br /><br />But&#8230;<br /><br /> Not all bugs would potentially have useful hints in the logs ya?.. what if the log rotates dammit.. my viewer has to cater to that - dammit.. my viewer/stamper would be deployment specific.. and also, while I&#8217;m at saving the developer&#8217;s time (avoid having to repeat the steps described)&#8230; I might as well save the QA&#8217;s time in describing his steps in the first place?<br /><br />I mean, the QA is using a computer ya? A computer knows and can record everything that goes through it, ya? Why not have a<br /><ol><li>Middle-layer sniffer to capture all to-fro traffic.. and a viewer counterpart that is able to (guess-timate) reproduce each originating (form fields prefilled)/resultant HTML page.. (how about javascripts on forms?)<br /></li><li>QA-specific-browser that records the buttons clicked, etc..  (how about browser compatibility?)</li><li>QA-tool that wraps any browser to collect data.. (big engineering effort? how about playback?)<br /></li><li>Plugins to browsers to collect such data and counterpart plugins to playback such data?</li></ol>The QA&#8217;s steps would thus be reduced to<br /><ol><li>Click &#8216;Start Test Case&#8217;</li><li>Go about doing his thing,.. and some error occurs<br /></li><li>Click &#8216;Report Bug&#8217; <br /></li><li>Go back to Step #1 to proceed with other things<br /></li></ol>All the back-end Bugzilla-like stuffs of opening bug, issue tracking, logging, recording steps, notifying developer could be automated at Step #3.. I&#8217;m not seasoned in the field of testing.. I haven&#8217;t even tried *gasp* JUnit.. and I&#8217;m not sure if a company like Mercury Interactive would&#8217;ve already had something like that.. <br /><br />But I would believe I can use something like that.<br /></p>
