		<p>Love pass me this link: http://www.apple.com/imac/ (brand new, hot from the oven!)<br /><br />My initial thoughts goes something like &quot;.. they&#8217;ve departed from the original iMac all-in-one design.. now this looks just like any other G5.. &quot; only for a moment there.. perhaps the webpage did a little cough and begged my attention further.. there is no CPU!<br /><br />One can argue that the first iMac are candy drops and looks much cuter blah blah.. but i like this one very much.<br /><br />iMac v1.0 shames the PC hardware designers. iMac v2.0 shames the Laptop &amp; PC hardware designers.

And I was worried some low-life ISV will custom some mail-application and secretly use Gmail as backend and continue $$elling email-hosting services to ignorant corporate folks&#8230; now someone has made a <a href="http://richard.jones.name/google-hacks/gmail-filesystem/gmail-filesystem.html">filesystem on gmail</a>!!

		<p>Came across <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/20020101.html">Ruby</a> few years back.. Read a bit but was too busy (as usual) to dwell on it further.<br /><br />Came across Ruby on Monday and was quite <a href="http://media.nextangle.com/rails/rails_setup.mov">wow</a>-ed. (Apple guys really think different huh? Never really came across a HOW-TO documentation in MOV format! Sweet!). I showed them to some of my J2EE colleagues and based on their scoffing replies, I perhaps should&#8217;ve better showed them <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000280.html">this</a> as well. <br /><br />I&#8217;ve been thinking about process inheritance (or service inheritance, in terms <a href="http://www.service-architecture.com/web-services/articles/service-oriented_architecture_soa_definition.html">SOA</a>) but also procastinated on reading a white paper on it. When I see Rail&#8217;s <a href="http://media.nextangle.com/rails/rails_setup.mov">scaffold at work</a> [rails_setup.mov].. , &quot;hey.. this is it isn&#8217;t it?&quot;<br /><br />The process is already written. Pages core to the functionalities already provided. Define your data and specify the process: I&#8217;ll need to work on the &quot;posts&quot; data, and I need the usual <a href="http://www.sourcecodecentral.com/sql.asp">CRUD</a> pages&#8230; Viola! List page, edit page, create page.., clicks, SQLs.. all written and all working and all bug free - else, just debug the super-class ya?.. oops I meant super-process. I&#8217;ve now inherited the CRUD process, implemented using my data store, extended with my own customised pages.<br /><br />So, is process inheritance afterall just defining a base set of navigation framework, and allowing template customisation? To have true hierarchy.. this new process, extended from the base CRUD process, must be allowed to be extended by the platform its written on. I like that.<br /><br />Perhaps really soon now, we can really have vending machine dispensing processes for anyone to extend - Coins in here, tap tap here.. tap tap there.. -PLONK!- a cdrom falls into the chute below and the programmer happily goes to work.. <br /></p>

		<p>I give up.. weeks ago CERT told everyone <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/713878/">not to use IE anymore</a> and every open source zealot (yes, me) started chanting, &#8216;Firefox! Firefox! Firefox! &#8216;.. I&#8217;d even managed to convert a couple of friends recently (1 end user, 1 developer) to junk IE related browsers. <br /><br />But hey, now there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5403">Firefox UI Spoofing</a>? *Phooey* (note to self: Gotta learn XUL!)<br /><br />So my options now are.. *drum roll*<br />4. Use <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Op(lease)era</a> browser. (hello adware)<br />3. Use text browser <a href="http://www.osvdb.org/displayvuln.php?osvdb_id=1234">Lynx</a> (bye bye pr0n pics)<br />2.

At some point in the show, I almost couldn&#8217;t catch my own breath.. darn good one Selina!<br /><br /><div style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;You call me the Parking Pontianah.. you curse me loud-ly.. you curse me loud-ly.. uh uh!<br /> You call me the Parking Pontianah.. I do my job proud-ly, I do my job proud-ly, uh uh!&quot;<br /></div> <br /> However, I must say I&#8217;m much dismayed with the CD purchased. The funniest part of the whole show were the stand-up jokes, between acts, etc.. unfortunately the CD only featured studio recorded songs.. boo hoo. I would&#8217;ve better desired a live recording that includes everything - including laughs from the crowd.. oh well!<br /> <br />Dollies dollies.. saw another VCD too.. took away only 1 quote with me.. <br /><br /><div style="margin-left: 40px;"> &quot;Bye..

		<p>My good friend Roger-Wabbit has decided to call it a day with the IT business. He&#8217;s started out as enthusiastic, DIY Linux hobbist.. but slowly moulded into a <a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~bofh/">BOFH</a> (kidding!). Anyways.. he&#8217;s moving up north to Terengganu to live out his diver dreams.. Hopefully the next time I travel up.. will be him teaching me to dive. <br /><br />One of my ex-boss has decided to call it a day with the IT business. Sounded tired over the phone. Perhaps much drained.. he&#8217;s taken care of his baby for 4 years now.. its time to let go and one&#8217;s gotta understand it must be hard. Hooking up my friend to take over the clients and contracts tomorrow.. hope it turns out well.<br /><br />My beloved Mr Goh has decided to call it a day. He looks happy though ;-) some has called him the in-between of two Lees&#8230; but I do like that guy. He gives you a snazzy warm feeling you&#8217;re taken care of (perhaps of his height.. can&#8217;t see his eyes thru the glasses clearly and assuring smile).. but I guess when someone leave in a good note, people tend to look at him in good light.</p><br />

		<p> Wow. Feels like being let out of jail. It has been a pretty long time since I have a peaceful weekend. Yes, not working this week. Today I woke at 12:45pm.. read the papers, Recruit section too.. lunch with my mom and built my <a href="http://www.stikfas.com/products.html">STIKFAS</a> dragon and watched Discovery channel - which coincidentally Love is gonna be working at, yea! - and hang out with my friends, get suckered into playing mahjong because there-ain&#8217;t-a-lot-else-to-do-in-their-house and lost some money&#8230; ya, life sure seem back to the way it was.<br /><br />Mental note: I must stop being suckered to mahjong in the future. I appreciate the game, more fun than Big2.. but I know I&#8217;ll definitely lose money. So, gambling is unarguably out.<br /><br />Anyways, printed and read <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">an article written by Paul Graham</a> recommended by my sinseh, <br /><br /><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Don&#8217;t be put off by the title. It&#8217;s not just about programmers, languages, etc.<br />It broaches on many subjects which make my heart string resonate. Enjoy!<br /></div><br />It really is an excellent read and how much I wish more people gets the message! .. -sigh-. Btw, time to intro my sinseh.. <br /> Though he doesn&#8217;t like me addressing him as sinseh but that&#8217;s the way its gonna be. Cheewai. I think he&#8217;s quite an extraordinaire.. first of all, he was willing to spend time inspiring a total stranger, ignorant idiot like me what the <a href="http://iroi.seu.edu.cn/books/ee_dic/whatis/hacker.htm">hacker</a> world is.. he was the person that taught me what a :-) smiley is - Woah! Next, he completes his masters in UK and dashes to <a href="http://www.gov.bw/home.html">Botswana</a> to help setup their IT infrastructure.. went to UN.. and now back at Botswana. What a kewl dude!<br /><br />The next inspiration has to go to The Guan.. whom would entertain many of my out-of-classroom can-i-do-this queries with, &quot;in theory, everything can be done&quot; and promptly showed me the prowers of unix. At a time when its fashionable to be I-don&#8217;t-give-grades-a-hoot.. he inspired the programmer in us to not just achieve.. but to out-do ourselves and each other..  and achieve &quot;elegance in code&quot;. Its a pity they don&#8217;t teach Lisp anymore. car car cdr cdr, cdr cdr car.. <br /><br />Mental note: Curiosity - Thou shalt not lose the spirit to ask, inquire and be the dumb one.<br /><br /></p>
