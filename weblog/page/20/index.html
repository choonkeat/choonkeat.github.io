		<p>When I was taking my part-time bachelor&#8217;s degree at <a href="http://www.auston.edu.sg/home/index.php">Auston</a> &quot;we take your education seriously!&quot; (think this deserves another blog post&#8230; ) I&#8217;ve had the fortune of having a <span style="font-style: italic;">great</span> lecturer for our web applications classes. The assignment she set for us: A Shopping Cart application. No server. No database. Javascripts only. Just a &quot;Success!&quot; page for payment.<br/>
<br/>
My reaction was: <span style="font-style: italic;">lame</span>. Her response: <span style="font-style: italic;">the rest of the (non IT background) students doesn&#8217;t have time to study the full fledged web applications stack</span>. I still think she was lazy and had undercut her students.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-forward a couple of years to present day,&#8230; something dropped in from the O&#8217;Reilly Radar today: <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/07/trimpath_wow.html">TrimPath</a>. Here&#8217;s a snippet from their &#8216;vision&#8217; statement:<br/>
<blockquote>In a nutshell: mindlessly copy and port Rails, because it&#8217;s a great web MVC framework. The result should be a web MVC framework that runs in either the client AND the server. While we&#8217;re at it, explore and push the edges of occasionally connected web applications.</blockquote><br />
<br/>
Rails? Occasionally connected web applications? These people were so inspired by <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Rails Way</span>, they&#8217;d created a complete development framework to do standalone (browser-based) applications - that can work during absence of connectivity!<br/>
<br/>
What does that mean? Just try out this simple application: <a href="http://trimpath.com/demos/nextaction_static1/nextaction.htm">Next Action</a>. Its a productivity tool (todo list, blah blah, even comes with <a href="http://trimpath.com/demos/nextaction_static1/nextaction.htm">beautiful statistics page</a>) only thing interesting is - <b>you can save it to your computer, and use the browser application without being connected to a network (<a href="http://trimpath.com/project/wiki/NextAction">read how</a>)</b>. Developers, checkout the &quot;show me the code&quot; link in the application. Sweet.<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br/>
</span> Now if that lecturer had defined the project to be &quot;A todolist application. No server. No database&quot;&#8230; *shudder* nah, she can&#8217;t possibly have grokked it this way.<br/></p>

		<p>Love has been away, learning diving in Tioman, since Friday and will be back around evening. Her mobile&#8217;s not roaming, so there goes contact. I&#8217;d be definitely lying if I say I ain&#8217;t worried one bit that she hasn&#8217;t called. Then there&#8217;s a thin line to thread before one crosses into the parentish/nagging/possessive zone. Then again, she hasn&#8217;t called her parentish/nagging/possessive aunt too.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of otherwise, I&#8217;d chosen to expend my restlessness <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd">on</a> <a href="http://tomorrow.sg/archives/2005/07/16/update_from_bloggerssg.html">other</a> <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2005/07/17/blogger-sg">things</a>. Went to Borders just now to get my monthly dosage of Linux magazine (old July issue still). Borders having 30% off paperbacks for every hard-cover purchase&#8230; nothing to buy. Hardcover? Isn&#8217;t hardcover kind of &quot;an inconvenience&quot;? <span style="font-style: italic;">Buy an inconvenience from us, and we give you a discount on the real comfy-for-your-to-read books</span>. Kind of like &#8217;<span style="font-style: italic;">Take MRT and win a car</span>&#8217; thing to me&#8230; Went upstairs into the Apple store for a stroll&#8230; I&#8217;m not a good shopper.<br/>
<br/>
On my way back to Goodwood Hotel (yeah, I&#8217;m a cheapo to park free there. shhh..), passing the DFS, a little boy at the bus stop caught my eye. Facing the DFS, rosy cheeks, carrying a big shopping bag, obviously not his, 2 big cups of McDonald&#8217;s coke. Visibly shaking. Visibly. If not for the expression on his face, and bead of anxiety&#8230; one would really think he&#8217;s trying to mix some nasty cocktail&#8230;<br/>
<br/>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;Are you ok?&quot; I asked, half-bending half-squatting since he only came up to my waist.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"/><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;My mother isn&#8217;t back yet. She gone already haven&#8217;t come back yet.&quot;</span><br style="font-style: italic;"/><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;Where did she go?&quot;</span><br style="font-style: italic;"/><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;She took my sister to the toilet. Haven&#8217;t come back yet.&quot;</span><br style="font-style: italic;"/><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;How long was it?&quot;</span><br style="font-style: italic;"/><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;20 minutes already. Haven&#8217;t come back yet&quot;</span><br/>
</div><br />
<br/>
At this moment, reminders of lame tv/movie plot comes to mind where long-lost couple reunited, only to be separated again when one scoots off to buy ice-cream or fetch water for another.. and then the bad guys come&#8230; and something happens&#8230; and&#8230;<br/>
<br/>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;Does she have a phone?&quot;</span><br style="font-style: italic;"/><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;Yes.. &quot;</span><br/>
</div><br />
<br/>
Turns out, his mum&#8217;s phone is in the shopping bag he&#8217;s carrying. Hmm. The last thing would be for the boy to go find her and create an indian-tree-dance, aka 2-way search. Leaving him there wouldn&#8217;t be good too. I&#8217;m as helpless.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;I wait with you ok?&quot;</span><br style="font-style: italic;"/><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;Ok..&quot; his eyes scanning the crowd eagerly.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"/><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;Your mum will be back soon, ok?&quot; What else? Other than lying to yourself?</span><br/>
</div><br />
<br/>
2 boys waited. <br/>
<br/>
He spotted a lady and her daughter walking out of the DFS some distance away. A <span style="font-style: italic;">confirm?</span> look, a solemn nod and I left the relieved boy alone to meet up with his mum. One boy&#8217;s wait is over. <br/>
<br/>
Well, it will be evening soon.</p>

		<blockquote>&quot;So, its gonna be this until the party at night ah?&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
I was asked whilst sitting on a high stool watching the <a href="http://tomorrow.sg/">Tomorrow.sg</a> ppl chat and IRC on TV. Apparently it isn&#8217;t an event that suited everyone&#8217;s taste. :-) <br/>
<br/>
Still it was interesting&#8230; seeing some faces, and recognizing them. Hope I wasn&#8217;t caught drooling. Had to leave for family dinner so was out of the scene from 4pm onwards.. but hell, things I&#8217;d missed:<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
    <li>Free booze til 2130hrs! I only made it back around 2200hrs to catch my ice-melted glass and get photos.. <br/>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://tomorrow.sg/archives/2005/05/13/bellydance_discovery.html">Belly dancers</a>! Luckily <a href="http://stupid-genius.blogspot.com/">StupidGenius</a> made good use of his 12x zoom camera. and printed me a color photo using the Lexmark provided there. Solid! It really looks as if she was dancing for him only, even though he must&#8217;ve hidden behind the counter or something - sheesh! But he was dismayed a chio one kept positioning herself to be blocked by the other dancers.</li>
    <li>Boobies made appearances. (Yes.. It had to happen). Damn. No other attendees get to see this one too,since the event was long over then, so I didn&#8217;t lose out too much. <a href="http://stupid-genius.blogspot.com/">StupidGenius</a> was caught too stunned to make use of his 12x this time. Looks like he still lack that blogger instinct.</li>
</ol>
And ya, <a href="http://xiaxue.blogspot.com/">Xiaxue</a> should really change her outdated pink photo. Just like mrbrown did. So late <a href="http://tomorrow.sg/">Tomorrow.sg</a> still hasn&#8217;t got a Blogger.SG post? Must be all still sleeeeeping..<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I&#8217;m really impressed with the way MSN supported the event in the background&#8230; considering all the laptops making appearances there were iBooks. Heh.

		<p>Don&#8217;t ask me how to pronounce it. Ask the British :-P at <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">djangoproject.com</a>. A quick look through the docs and stuff (no 10 minute video -sulk-) seems to show that this framework <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">gets it</span> as well. Some differences of cos (some would argue big differences), but generally its heart warming to see the trend of framework-works-for-developer (rather than developer-works-for-framework) picks up&#8230; aka &quot;<a href="http://www.jrandolph.com/blog/?p=8">Web 3.0 Frameworks</a>&quot;. <br/>

I hope Rails learns to play with Django and they&#8217;ll not smite each other (if not friends, don&#8217;t be enemies). The world <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> big enough.

		<p>I didn&#8217;t notice when but the number of feeds subscribed in Rssfwd seem to have jumped a couple of hundreds since I last counted (quite a number of Bittorrent sites.heh) Unfortunately, that also kind of brought Rssfwd to a crawl. So, in order to minimize the impact of us regular users, I&#8217;ve decided to separate the slower feeds (i.e. huge feeds takes a long time to parse in DOM) from the normal sized feeds. <br/>
<br/>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Normal feeds</span>: 2 hours interval.<br/>

Hope things return to normal hence. Anyone can suggest a faster XML library than <a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/">REXML</a>? Or maybe I should just re-do in SAX.. *<span style="font-style: italic;">groan</span>*.<br/></p>

		<p>Below is an email Q&amp;A I had recently: <blockquote><br />
<p><strong>I know u are a proponent of Ruby on Rails. What is the main thing about the Rail f/w that is so productive?</strong><br/>
</p><br />
</blockquote>First thing, before the wrong foot etc.. <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2005/06/14/wrong-fight">this entry</a> will clarify what i think Rails positioning is. So, the keywords i guess is: quick &amp; agile.<br/>
<blockquote><br />
<p><strong>a) Ruby the scripting language?</strong><br/>
</p><br />
</blockquote>maybe its a the joy of learning a new language&#8230; but ruby is quite fun to code in, albeit the lack of code-completion editors (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rubyeclipse">maybe not for long</a>). but perhaps its b&#8217;cos i&#8217;d programmed without code-completion for the larger part so can still settle with that lack.<br/>
<br/>
update: I&#8217;d forgotten to mention that I missed the power and ease of arrays in a scripting language (compared to Java or C), and also the code block syntax in Ruby is insanely cool even <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/07/12/ruby-colored-blocks-in-python/">when compared to</a> a beautiful language like Python.<br/>
<blockquote><br />
<p><strong>b) The framework (What part of it)</strong><br/>
</p><br />
</blockquote>I like that it comes with a pretty good ORM. Also, I only need to know very few conventions to get started. Yes these can be generalized into &quot;small learning curve&quot;.<br/>
<blockquote><br />
<p><strong>Why no Java/.Net/C++/VB etc has copied it point for point then ?</strong><br/>
</p><br />
</blockquote>Regarding clones, there is: <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000276.html">.Net</a>, <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=29716">Java</a>, <a href="http://subway.python-hosting.com/">Python</a>, even <a href="http://ripcord.co.nz/biscuit/forum/?controller=forum&amp;action=index">PHP</a>. But who&#8217;s interested? - and that&#8217;s actually quite important question: Can framework-X garner the same level of PR/momentum/growth? Clones are just pet projects out to prove X-can-also-do-Y. The original is currently used for bread-and-butter projects by DHH and <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/scoble_wonders_if_37signals_is_influencing_microsoft.php">co</a>. So they&#8217;re very actively on it, using it, etc. The original was <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000416.html">extracted from a project, not written to a designed spec</a>. Why not somebody invest to use those clones as bread-and-butter? Well, wouldn&#8217;t that somebody rather use Rails instead? unless, of cos, they&#8217;ve an axe to grind against Rails.<br/>
<blockquote><br />
<p><strong>c) The domain chosen?</strong><br/>
</p><br />
</blockquote>hmm, don&#8217;t really understand. its for building general web apps.<br/>
<blockquote><br />
<p><strong>d) The philosophy ?</strong><br/>
</p><br />
</blockquote>Probably. convention over configuration is probably the first breath of fresh air. i&#8217;d originally cited this as a &quot;no xml config file nightmare&quot; thing, but actually it runs deeper, especially parameters passed to-and-fro forms/post, database column naming, before_* after_* hooks (benefits from very primitive AOP), where the files are placed (easy to learn another app) etc.<br/>
<br/>
When doing Rails, I feel as if somebody has felt the same pain as I and here are his consolidated solution for each and every problem, and I gratefully receive a solution for our lessons learnt.<br/>
<br/>
Very little things - <span style="font-style: italic;">may be detrimental to cite this example and make it seem like child&#8217;s play</span>.. but I found myself smiling when I learnt this - like e.g. having an &#8216;employee_counter&#8217; column in the &quot;companies&quot; table.. just having it and Rails will do the rest: e.g. +1 whenever a new &quot;employees&quot; record is inserted. very little things. update: also, a verbose error 500 page with stacktrace, session data, http parameters by default - but when in production mode, outside world sees &#8216;friendly error page&#8217;.. but localhost still gives you the verbose errors to help debugging, how thoughtful!<br/>
<br/>
And for the record, this is the blog entry that I stumbled upon Rails: <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5424?page=last&amp;x-maxdepth=0">Award for beautiful coding: David Heinemeier Hansson</a><br/>
<br/>
update: I&#8217;d also forgotten to mention that I&#8217;d always preferred saving <i>development time</i> than saving <i>runtime</i>.</p>

		<p>I use Linux at work, at home, and had been Linux administrator for a couple of years. I love it, I really do. When someone says its no good, I feel like my child&#8217;s been told he&#8217;s ugly. I was even accused of being a Linux bigot.<br/>
<br/>
But I still don&#8217;t think Linux is ready for <span style="font-weight: bold;">mainstream</span> desktop usage. By mainstream, I mean adoption. Not technically ready or not. Adoption in the future? Yes (please!). Now? No. And so, I&#8217;m quite sad to see <a href="http://emergerandom.blogspot.com/2005/07/we-have-made-linux-ready-now-lets-make.html">this article</a> and what&#8217;s more surprising is that Dvorak <a href="http://www.dvorak.org/blog/?p=2350">recommended it</a> so highly:<br/>

&quot;This is hands down the best article I&rsquo;ve read in the past year.&quot;<br/>

Really? Now, I think I&#8217;m probably more sad that <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">that&#8217;s</span> the best article Linux desktop argument can go. <br/>

I like the article&#8217;s observation that it is unfair for Linux that John-Doe-type users jumps to Linux without knowing anything only to leave with a disgusted experience. Good start. I can also agree to his comments on &quot;Filesystems, C:, D:, etc&quot; being a non-issue.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>But don&#8217;t be ridicolous tellimg me that typing &quot;emerge gaim&quot; is difficult, please. The fact the user has no training for typing &quot;emerge foo&quot; IS WRONG, not the package manager. Users need to learn, THEN to use the system. Would you click on an executable installer, if no one ever told you that&#8217;s the way to install software?<br />
</blockquote><br />
<br/>
<br/>
Yahh&#8230; but before I gathered my own thoughts properly, he moved on to describe how to deal with non-packaged applications&#8230; and compiling. That&#8217;s it. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, given a 2-lab-rat scenario I&#8217;d agree (almost, see next para). I would even argue that the lab-rat typing &quot;emerge foo&quot; will find it smoother to do. Usability.<br/>
<br/>
But gravity pulls down and Windows is double-click install. These are facts even lab tests should adhere to. The Linux way may be more elegant, manageable. But without a <span style="font-weight: bold;">bridge</span> from Windows-land it&#8217;ll not work. Assuming that new users has no background is really quite a stretch. Even the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chris_pratley/archive/2004/04/27/120944.aspx">then-new-comer Microsoft Excel had to bend to Lotus 123&#8217;s rules</a> before winning their market.<br />
 <i>[Update: I figure <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000052.html">this Joel article</a> is a better example.]</i><br />
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic;">But.. Linux has double-click installers too!</span> All of them? Most of them? Some this, some that&#8230; but that&#8217;s not a fault of Linux in itself - its a diverse, vibrant community - but when it comes to adoption and learnability, that&#8217;s a glaring hole. How do you tell a your restaurant customer, with a straight face, &quot;Tell the waitress your order she&#8217;ll bring to your table.. meat only. Veges you gotta get yourself from there - its free flow! Drinks are available from the vending machines outside. Hot drinks, we only have 3-in-1&#8230; yes everything is in the pantry you can make them yourself.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
One face. Macintosh has it. John Doe users switch to Macs doesn&#8217;t seem to have such hoohas. Even though Macs are different too. In fact they think different (corny). Filesystem&#8217;s different too. Heck, OS X is even a Unix! I used to think Redhat was the company to do it for Linux. But apparently they&#8217;re not interested in John Doe. Until Linux presents itself a single face (not necessarily only 1 company) and learn to play by the defacto rules (Windows)&#8230; Linux will remain supreme, but not for the mainstream desktop.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think I&#8217;m more sad that its the best punch Linux can pull off, than with the article&#8217;s content itself.<br/></p>
