		<p>Good to hear that my <a href="http://www.google.com/">bestest friend</a> is going to launch a free, desktop searching tool code-named Puffin. In fact, I was just lamenting to my friend that searching the entire web is faster than looking for stuffs in on my harddisk.. which is least to say, a very pathetic and ironic state of affairs. In fact, <a href="http://www.blackball.us/b/nav//products/products/blackmagic">BlackMagic</a> recently caught my eye and seems impressive..  looks like a potential filler before Longhorn.. but now, we&#8217;re gonna have Puffin too :-)</p><p>What BlackMagic has, in addition, is version control.. Kewl. Version control all your files in a particular drive.. easily search them too.. the non-IT saavy folks could at last use &quot;CVS&quot; with full integration to their desktop, plus ability to search - fast! -.. these to me, is the holy grail of desktop computing indeed. For what&#8217;s the computer desktop for, if it doesn&#8217;t increase your productivity???</p><p>Google has reinvented the email by using (their) search technology and challenging current norms (disk space, mail folders, delete mails). E-mailing has indeed changed since I used Gmail.. there&#8217;s only 3 things to do after reading a mail, archive it, mark as spam, reply to it. No more folders.. put where.. delete la.. i don&#8217;t need it.. do i need it?.. Archive! Simple change of mindset, a revolution not to be under-estimated. Changing the little things can sometimes start an epidemic.. (i&#8217;m reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316346624/102-1354649-2598548?v=glance">Tipping Point</a>)</p><p>Anyways.. I hope they&#8217;ll reinvent something this time too. Surprise me, pleasantly.</p>

		<p> Was reading an <a href="http://software.newsforge.com/software/04/05/10/1235236.shtml?tid=151&tid=2&tid=82&tid=94">interview </a>with BitKeeper author, Larry McVoy. How I wish its possible for widespread belief of message.. quoted below :<br /> <div align="justify"><blockquote><i>There was concern at the beginning that maybe we were trying to exploit the kernel team somehow. Our position has always been that we were and are sincere in our desire to help the community. Nobody believes in a free lunch, so many people try to figure out &quot;what&#8217;s the catch?&quot; The more vocal we were regarding our sincerity, the more suspicious people became. That&#8217;s human nature and there isn&#8217;t much we can do about it other than continue to demonstrate that we will do the right thing. I used to work at Google and their &quot;do no evil&quot; motto is something that I took away from them. It&#8217;s a good way to run a business, but it makes people wonder a bit. People expect corporations to be &quot;evil,&quot; but not all of the corporations are evil. Google is a very visible company trying to do the right thing; we&#8217;re a far less visible company but we are also trying to do the right thing. It is possible to do the right thing and make money and maybe Google&#8217;s example will inspire other companies to follow suit.</i><br /></blockquote></div><br />Have a nice day.<br /> <br /></p>

		<p>I&#8217;m mainly involved in Java programming, hence the ResourceBundle is synonymous to i18n. Its a good framework at runtime (when the program is running).. but one&#8217;s gotta admit is a very expensive process at codetime (when writing the program). Its a pain to introduce the map languages, strings, keys for the sake of &quot;multi-lingual support should the product ever go into the China/India/<insert country="" your="" />(insert your favourite country) market&quot;.. <br /><br />GUI IDE (integrated development environment) only takes 1 step closer by helping you with GUI tables for managing the i18n text.. but its still a very painful process.<br /><br />Luckily there is a better way!<br /><br /></insert />Why not do i18n as a post-thought. i.e. Write applications like they&#8217;re only for your native language (that&#8217;s how everyone intuitively does it anyways).. and only add i18n support when you need to the product to do so. It can be a pretty GUI ant-task that parses the source code, looks for static strings (for HTML codes, any text that is not embraced within angled brackets) and checks with the user how the string should be i18n. The user-experience to run such a post-production process would greatly mirror those doing a spell checker in Word (-gasp- i&#8217;m quoting MS again.. i must be defecting) The i18n-checker goes through the source and resources, and prompts for replacements.. it should handle things like:<br /><br />- &quot;Apply changes to all&quot; to not ask the same things again.. or a select from list of translations for easy re-usability.<br />- Support placing of arguments, e.g. &quot;Hello, {0}&quot; and &quot;{0}, &#20320;&#22909;&quot;, in a intuitive manner<br />- Support multi-pass parsing. i.e. the user may not have the time to sit and translate the whole source tree in 1-pass. Subsequent patches to the code should be parsable without re-parsing the old portions.<br /><br />I think its very do-able (at least in the preliminary).. by looking for static text and changing them into ResourceBundle calls (after prompting for user input).. <br /><br />Doing i18n in any other way, IMHO, is simply a waste of the developers&#8217; man-hours.<br /></p>

		<p>Love has been debating with me on what Jason Mraz&#8217;s been mouthing in a very popular song recently, <a href="http://www.jasonmraz.com/Lyrics/YouAndIBoth.html">You &amp; I Both</a>. It was until this afternoon that we&#8217;d settled it once and for all, with the help of my <a href="http://www.google.com/">bestest friend</a>. I still can&#8217;t believe he could sing &quot;What you and I spoke of&quot; in 2-syllabus?! Or what seems like 2 syllabus to me.. it certainly sounded like he was saying &quot;You and I both Loved.. Hougang.. &quot;. </p><p>Love says I&#8217;m crazy and deaf. Dear SG, listen to the song (the next time) and tell me if I&#8217;m entirely off.</p><p>Btw, got myself a moblog (wee!) though its not a DIY and neither is it integrated into this blog.. at least that&#8217;s something!<br /></p>

		<p> Feedback and FAQ is nothing new to the Internet. But they&#8217;re often always separate entities of a website. Was browsing around my gmail (beta) account and clicked on the &quot;Feedback&quot; link.. which i would guess power their main beta-testing-feedback process.<br /><br />* [Page 0] Click &quot;Feedback&quot;<br />* [Page 1] Select category of feedback and give a &quot;Subject&quot; for your feedback (doubles as a search criteria too)<br />* [Page 2] Display snippets of matching FAQ (and their answers) on top, with links to click &quot;read more.. &quot;<br />                Display more form fields to complete the feedback (reply-to email, question details, etc)<br /><br />I think this is a very self-sufficient sub-system which is truely useful to both the end-user and administrators. The FAQ presented on top discourages persons to asking questions asked before.. also helps the user to search through the FAQ while trying to suggest/ask/feedback something&#8230; <br /><br />Just feel a tad dismayed that such sub-system isn&#8217;t already a norm in the industry already. Somebody should do an open source project like this.. Not sure if <a href="http://faqomatic.sourceforge.net/">FAQ-O-Matic</a> already does.. but i think not.<br /><br />So, WWW (that&#8217;s you, reader), why would anyone want to do a FAQ without a Feedback, a Feedback without a FAQ.. why would anyone want to implement anything that doesn&#8217;t have the above flow? Other than lack of resources to implement?<br /><br /><br /></p>

		<p>[background: taking a break here from my course, the rest are munching happily away at dunno what pastries.. ]<br /><br />Was just lamenting to my friend-now-colleague that I miss my Linux desktop (using Win2k now, due to project time-line and I don&#8217;t wanna jeopardise any co-operative tasks by installing Linux) because of the virtual-desktop provided by X11.<br /><br />Then now, I found <a href="http://virt-dimension.sourceforge.net/">Virtual Dimension</a> &#8230; it rocks! Anybody who finds themselves having to work with too much windows, browsers, word docs, email, websites for personal browsing (read: research, not pr0n), web sites for work,&#8230; I personally often arrange all my windows in a particular manner so that I can observe debugging info on console.. running logs elsewhere.. access the console.. view my source code and HTML output.. and these are considered ONE environment.. none should serve much purpose without the others.. and when I need to check mail, I&#8217;ll switch to my other desktop with only my email program, without the clutter I of development desktop.. after I&#8217;m done with my mail, i&#8217;ll switch back.. with all the many many windows in arranged/opened in the same way.. oh well.. the list can just go on.. but I really like virtual desktops.. and any OS without it simply hampers my productivity. <br /><br />Now.. back to training<br /><br /></p>

		<p>Locally born IT companies here in Singapore generally does System-Integrator (SI) jobs.. hire programmers, hire sales, pitch for (govt?) projects, get clients to sign-off, do projects, haggle over signed specs, finish up the project and put them up as trophy to pitch for another project&#8230;. Some better ones build their product line at the same time too&#8230;</p><p>Its my suspicion that this trend is born out of tradition.. familiarity, rather than long run benefits. &quot;Its been done before, it works and our company is surviving&quot;&#8230; &quot;Everyone does it this way, I&#8217;m even doing it cheaper/faster/better (pick any 2)&quot;&#8230; </p><p>I&#8217;ll not look at yet-another-non-descript SI small shops with no real software asset (read: product) and basically sweeps any project there is in market.. I&#8217;ll want to talk about local companies with products, a (humbly speaking: potentially) good one that is. Furthermore, a product that targets developers - a platform - an enabling technology that helps developers develop better.</p><p /><p>I&#8217;m a technie and I&#8217;ll continue to see business models from my ignorant, utopian point of view until convinced otherwise.</p><p>Why open source a company&#8217;s core product? Doing SI jobs with our own product helps our product to grow (with real-world deployments and user/developer feedback) and gets it deployed in major (given the clients are big names) businesses as well. Doing SI jobs gives us money back to do more SI and have more improvements.</p><p>Correct. But why not do it faster?</p><p>Open sourcing the product spreads the concept behind the product far, and wide (to what extend, depends on effort and open source PR). Giving it away <strong>empowers other people</strong> to do <strong>their</strong> applications <strong>faster</strong> (its an enabling technology), <strong>better</strong> (the product is well thought out and robust) and now&#8230; <strong>cheaper</strong> (its free!). Developers can tinker, develop with the product.. developers or companies can use it to develop their product and in turn, sell it to their clients.. So, not only does the number of people doing SI jobs with the product grow exponentially, the sales team selling the product capability grows with it too.. </p><p>What&#8217;s in it for us? More hands. Working with the product and using it. More potential fixes,.. but to me the most exciting part is more features, platforms and language support! </p><p>Show me the money!! - how does our sales close future SI projects? Won&#8217;t clients run off with other SI using -cough- our own product?? <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4715">MySQL</a> seem to have that reconciled pretty well with dual licensing.. and I won&#8217;t go into debate on how that&#8217;ll not work for our asian market here, argue with Mr Goh, since he told us to think ourselves as global citizens.. </p><p>Question, do you believe what your product is good? good enough? will ever be good enough? good enough in time? in time for what? in time before somebody else, with more resources than you, think that your product is good&#8230; so good that they&#8217;d want to do a better alternative and sell too. What then? Won&#8217;t clients run off with other SI using -cough- this other better product?? </p><p>Not a taking a swipe at MS here, but what&#8217;s there to stop them or anyone else from throwing resources at a good idea and flooding the market with 99cents product, again? Think BizTalk, IE and MS Word. If <strong>you</strong> believe humbly its too flattering to assume anyone else will see your product as attractive enough to do so.. then i&#8217;ll despise you even more for selling stuffs you don&#8217;t even believe in (read: snake-oil).</p><p>[This one is for the humble asians] But its not good enough to be seen by the world yet.. Hey, checkout Linux when it was born. For that matter, check yourself out. </p><p><em>He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose - Jim Elliot</em></p>
