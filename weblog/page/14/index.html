		<p>The equivalent question several years ago was, &quot;<em>What was the easiest way to learn and write HTML?</em>&quot;</p><p>How do you display tables in a web page? Go to a page with tables, view-source and write the same. Alternatively, if its too tiring to surf the web for the feature you want to copy, just fire-up FrontPage or DreamWeaver (blasphemy!), create what you want (e.g. an image map) and view source. Tada!</p><p>Now, what&#8217;s the easiest way to learn Ajax? e.g. the <a href="http://demo.script.aculo.us/ajax/autocompleter">google suggest-ish auto-complete</a>.</p><p>Simple as 1 2 3, </p><ol><li>Do it in Rails once: <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/images/autocomplete1.mov">3 steps demo (.mov file)</a> or <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/06/09/rails_ajax.html">O&#8217;Reilly tutorial</a> <br /></li><li>Copy the HTML (view-source), the javascript files (yes, the ajax javascripts are MIT licensed, aka you can do anything you want) and <br /></li><li>Re-implement the server-side yourself (this is the familiar part for most).</li></ol><p>And of cos, arm yourself with some <a href="http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000252.html">Ajax Debugging</a> facility <em>just in case</em>.<br /></p><p>Examples are plenty: <a href="http://demo.script.aculo.us/shop">Drag-drop shopping cart</a>, <a href="http://demo.script.aculo.us/ajax/sortable_elements">Drag-drop list</a>, <a href="http://sean.treadway.info/demo/upload/">Upload progressbar</a>, and many more</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p> <p>Something that slipped my radar: Rails Engines. </p><p>Woah.. I know there&#8217;s already several ways to help/add/modify Rails..&nbsp; there are generators, helpers, and the (kind of) new plugins. But engines?</p> <blockquote>Rails Engines are a way of dropping in whole chunks of functionality into your existing application without affecting any of your existing code. They could also be described as mini-applications, or vertical application slices &ndash; top-to-bottom units which provide full <span class="caps">MVC</span> coverage for a certain, specific application function.<br /> (see <a href="http://rails-engines.org/">http://rails-engines.org/</a> )</blockquote> <p>Interesting.. I <em>can</em> think of a few uses of mini-apps already&#8230; so now, let&#8217;s look at what the community has written for each (from the wiki): <a class="existingWikiWord" href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/Plugins">Plugins</a>, <a class="existingWikiWord" href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/Rails+Engines">Rails Engines</a>, <a class="existingWikiWord" href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/3rdPartyLibs">3rdPartyLibs</a>. <a class="existingWikiWord" href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/3rdPartyHelpers">3rdPartyHelpers</a> and <a class="existingWikiWord" href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/AvailableGenerators">AvailableGenerators</a>.</p>   <p>Yea. The first thought that comes to mind is&#8230; mess. So many selections that I think there might be enough mess for a distro to happen. e.g. In RailsX distro, the scaffolded apps is ajax-ified, or RailsY distro comes ready with a login/password/forget-password mini-app, or <a href="http://railsexpress.de/blog/">RailsZ</a> has defaults optimized for speed (imho, more aptly named as <a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2018.html">shinkansen</a>).. <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenRails</a> is optimized for security&#8230; EasyRails comes complete with Ruby installed and servers configured&#8230; oops, that&#8217;s already <a href="http://instantrails.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl">InstantRails</a>, though I&#8217;m not sure if it had intended itself to be. Anyways, distros are much better than forking aye? And to some extent, might just relieve the core team from dealing with a <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/WishList">variety of wishes</a>.<br />  </p>   <p>In whichever case, if distros do happen, lets just hope the package distribution mechanism remains on the plate of the core so that things will work cross-distro- think RPM, DEB,.. and then there&#8217;s Ubuntu DEB.. irk! <br /> </p></p>

		<p>&quot;<em>Translate from [what] language to [what] language</em>&quot;</p>

<p>How odd. I go to any translation service, and that&#8217;s what they&#8217;ll ask me. More often than not, when I need a translation, I don&#8217;t even know what language it is. Seriously, I really can&#8217;t tell Portuguese from Spanish. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a tool I wrote to help myself: <a href="http://dev.choonkeat.com/js/lang/index" title="Try and translate">try-anslator</a>.</p>

<p> It uses <a href="http://www.xrce.xerox.com/competencies/content-analysis/tools/guesser-ISO-8859-1.en.html">Xerox&#8217;s Language Guesser</a> together with <a href="http://www.google.com.sg/language_tools?hl=en">Google Language tool</a>. (First choice <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/">Babelfish</a> went out of their way to stop programmers like me, so I stopped)</p>

<p>Its not the best translation in the world, but at least it gives me a good feel of what the text is talking about.. plus I see what language it was. Be gentle now, I&#8217;m not running on a dedicated machine.</p>

		<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jpda/jdwp-spec.html">Java(TM) Debug Wire Protocol</a> allows a debugger to work from a different machine than the process itself. But that&#8217;s just a technical benefit.</p><p>A server (e.g. <a href="http://www.jboss.com/products/jbossas">JBoss</a>) started up with JDWP enabled will be ready to be plugged-in for debugging anytime. An <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse IDE</a> holding a project&#8217;s source code <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/faq/eclipse-faq.html#users_18">can connect to such servers anytime</a> and start a debugging session. The server is already running the binary classes, the IDE holds the source files.</p><p>Let&#8217;s not treat is like a debugging session (sounds like an &#8216;other thing to do&#8217;), take it as a development session&#8230;</p><p>Through a browser, the developer can go about his routine navigations *click* *click* and development *click*. When required, set a breakpoint in his source code (Eclipse) - back at the browser, do a form post, and Viola! the browser is kept spinning, JBoss comes to its knees, <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/os-ecbug/">Eclipse highlights the line-of-code</a> where we&#8217;ve paused and asks, &#8217;<em>The world awaits your wish, sire?</em>&#8217;</p><p>At this moment, you can inspect variable values, make changes to the source code and save - Eclipse will compile your code automatically and update the remote class for you. Then you click resume in Eclipse, and everything else springs back to life - with the changes taking effect. Change source codes, save, see effect. In rapid fire succession. JSP already auto-compiles, now I can do the same for controllers. I can live with that. <br /></p><p>I think app servers should come default in &quot;development mode&quot; with JDWP enabled (production install in enterprise setting always needs to be tuned anyways). Such things shouldn&#8217;t be left to be discovered. Or am I missing something here? Or because JDWP doesn&#8217;t handle <em>some</em> edge cases, so its not <em>good enough</em> to be turned on?<br /></p>

		<p>Its quite common to mis-position a new technology (e.g. <a href="http://educ.ubc.ca/courses/lled301/textbook/multimedia/timeline.html">paper</a> was first used for wrapping, only later for writing). Rails and Ajax could be one of them. <br /><br />
A wrong battle is being fought out there - and this one is probably as wrong as how we were once sold on an interactive technology called the Java Applet.<br /><br />
Some might scoff at Web2.0 attempts like <a href="http://www.writely.com/">Writely</a> to replace MS Word, or <a href="http://numsum.com/scratch/new">NumSum</a> replacing Excel. I believe its not about whether they can match feature for feature (they can&#8217;t) since good enough is often good enough, and people will be willing to settle for common features. But rather, its more against the idea of using a somewhere-out-there 3rd party tool - Hey, can I trust them with my confidential data? Also, I do need it tomorrow noon ya know? &quot;<span style="font-family: Courier New;">We&#8217;re currently down for maintenance</span>&quot; will be the last thing I want to see. Its the same distrust that some people still have, that they&#8217;d print out on paper even if when they own the softcopy: <span style="font-style: italic;">its somewhere-out-there in that harddisk, I&#8217;d rather file a physical copy in the cabinet</span>.<br /><br />
This generation think-gap can be bridged. If you can use Writely as a <span style="font-style: italic;">desktop</span> word processor, would you? Network connectivity is optional (for some online-payable services, watever), but not necessary. If its in my computer and I can use it as and when I like, what do I care if its actually &quot;browser-based&quot; or a &quot;native window&quot; application? When I click save, the file is saved in my folder, in my harddisk. Mine. Mine, mine, mine.<br /><br />
The good thing about deploying web technology on desktop is the recycling of skillset and technology - regardless of writing for desktop or the web, a developer would never have to leave his comfortable browser + database technologies. The same app can be hosted (newer generation: my data is always-on, yippie!) or run as plain-old Mac app, Windows app, or Unix app. OpenOffice, for example, uses <a href="http://hsqldb.org/">HSQLDB</a> as its storage so its not news that traditionally client-server technologies are finding their way to the desktop. Why bother with platform dependent widget libraries (gtk? qt? swt, swing, cocoa?) when there&#8217;s the omnipresent HTML + browser combo, readily available even in handhelds? Without a network roundtrip, the UI will be responsive. <span style="font-style: italic;">For a number of applications</span>, such a setting is probably good enough.<br /><br />
So, in such a desktop app, the underlying web platform would preferably be light-weight instead of scalable N-tiered. No kitchen sink Weblogic, sorry. Webrick or Lighty will do just fine. Served from flexible ports please, we don&#8217;t want to see port-already-in-use when its just me trying to edit my spreadsheet. No Oracle-the-overkill too, not even MySQL. Sqlite will suffice - something with no extra config, cross platform and doesn&#8217;t require a separate install. <br /><br />
Hence, regarding the &quot;wrong battle&quot;, the impact of Rails + Ajax might not be in the JEE or .Net realm after all. <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails&#8217;</a> strength is in providing a productive, consistent and simple platform. Ajax pursues to deliver <a href="http://www.backbase.com/">complex, responsive UI</a> via the browser. Riding on the re-ignition of browser technologies, the real playground, as the famous saying goes: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Its%20the%20desktop%2C%20stupid">Its the desktop, stupid</a>. <br /><br />
