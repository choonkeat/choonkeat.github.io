    <li>Allow to bookmark (1 or many) locations</li><br />

		<p>Went to Holland V on Sunday to makan with Love. And of cos, the primary objective is to try out the really kewl Segways!<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jhartley/15986382/"><img border="0" src="http://photos11.flickr.com/15986382_ee65ab8393_t_d.jpg" alt="Segway Polo"/></a><br/>
<br/>
Yeah. The authorities say its part of an effort to &quot;<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/149699/1/.html">to introduce new technologies</a>&quot;.. (<span style="font-style: italic;">new? won&#8217;t other ppl laugh and say its <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000343027143/">a four-year-old product.</a></span>?) And btw, didn&#8217;t know that place is &quot;one north&quot;.. i mean, north of where? Jurong Island? Anyways!.. the experience isn&#8217;t at all <span style="font-style: italic;">thrilling</span> as I&#8217;d hoped - I thought it would be Calvin and Hobbes kind of thrilling.. but not.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, there wasn&#8217;t enough going around, and 1 demonstrator was nonchalantly riding it up and down the Holland V slope, talking on his handphone, perhaps to his girlfriend of watever, leaving only 2 more fella entertaining more passer bys. Up and down.. up and down he went&#8230;<br/>
<br/>
Then when its my turn, the fella was holding on to the Segway! I mean, the guy made me feel like I was.. <br/>
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/malloys/16568270/"><img border="0" src="http://photos14.flickr.com/16568270_c0532d1fdb_t_d.jpg" alt="Pony Ride"/></a><br/>
<br/>
Sheesh. Its a Segway buddy! If I can&#8217;t really feel the balancing mechanism for myself, what&#8217;s the different from standing on a stool? Even <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> gave much more leeway for Love when she was learning to cycle. Should&#8217;ve guessed that I won&#8217;t be able to ride <span style="font-style: italic;">up and down</span> anywhere based on the location they&#8217;d chosen to display the Segways. I thought they would&#8217;ve chosen some open area like those in front of nobody-goes-there-shops near the carpark&#8230;<br/>
<br/>
Grr!&#8230; and I did choose to have lunch at Holland V precisely to try <span style="font-style: italic;">Segway </span>ya know?<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, had to fillup a survey after that. I&#8217;d rather wish they&#8217;d made me sign a &quot;i shall not hold authorities any responsibilities&quot; form and let me scooted around Holland V.<br/></p>

		<p>After 24hrs.. Railsday ended yesterday 1pm local time. I stank.</p>
<p>Glancing at the app I wrote, I said &quot;<em>Damn! 24 hours and only this? I should&#8217;ve finished it in a couple of hours!</em>&quot; But that&#8217;s hindsight. The most demoralising moment during the competition was when I followed a Railsday update and looked at <a href="http://www.anarchogeek.com/images/nutrient_screenshot.png">some ppl&#8217;s&nbsp;screenshot</a>. Regrets? Sure, I should&#8217;ve been more prepared. My stylesheets and design looked like it was picked up from the trash, crumpled, rethrown and pasted on the web. I did realise early on that &quot;<em>look and feel is important!</em>&quot; and decided to delegate the last 3 hours into just that.. no matter what ok? last 3 hours, spruce it up! Yeaahh rite. Also, I should&#8217;ve charted out detailed milestones early on, and just execute during&nbsp;Railsday&nbsp;- and don&#8217;t deviate from the plan! Shuffling my feet costed me a good few hours.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m getting that PSP, iPod&nbsp;or Mac Mini. But! That wasn&#8217;t my stated reason of my participation yah? (save face) It was learning, and learning I did. Because of the nature of my app (for others to write an app), I don&#8217;t think I can safely put up it up for trying anytime soon. But, if you&#8217;re interested to see what others has <em>beautifully</em> done, try visiting: <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2005/06/05/playing-with-rails-day-projects#comments">list of some of them</a>, <a href="http://friendr.com/user/login">Friendr</a>, <a href="http://spacetag.allconsuming.net/">Space Tag</a>, <a href="http://66.92.15.36/">Nutrient</a>, &nbsp;<a href="http://tackboard.trivialbydesign.com/">Tackboard</a>, <a href="http://overstimulate.com/articles/2005/06/05/rails-lesson-learned">some google map thing</a>, and the adventurous people can check out the projects directly from the <a href="http://railsday.com/svn/">SVN repository described</a>.</p>

		<p>Finally thought of something to do for Railsday this Saturday!! :-D For the uninformed, Railsday is a day where teams(1 to 3) participate in a 24-hour hackathon to come up with some kewl Rails apps - checkout the <a href="http://railsday.com/prizes">drool worthy prizes</a>! But I&#8217;d like to add, very straight-faced, that the greatest prize will be the opportunity to learn more Rails in 24 hours - more efficient than any self-disciplined project will give.</p><p>Since there are plenty more coders out there more familiar with this young framework (me the newbie am learning <strong>so much</strong> just by looking at <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/">Typo blog</a> source code, so you know where I stand) I bet I can&#8217;t win on &#8221;<a href="http://railsday.com/rules">Completeness, Code quality and UI</a>&#8221; so I&#8217;ll be hoping for the other areas like creativity and usefulness. Sadly colleagues whom have heard my idea says I&#8217;m delusionally excited. *pooh*</p><p>Nevertheless, I&#8217;ve gotten my hands on the latest (only) <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/">Rails Bible</a> hoping it&#8217;ll ward off all evils. Smart guys these publishers.. Railsday coming up and they release their &#8220;beta e-book&#8221; for sale - so I&#8217;m suckered. But its good, 50 pages of selected reading and I think I can cut out 1/3 of my code in <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/">Rssfwd</a>.</p><p>And honestly, if I were back, working in small independent software houses, creating web applications and hosting (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_service_provider">ASP model</a>) for clients (e.g. ex-companies).. I&#8217;ll definitely push to use Rails. </p><p>Because I&#8217;d want to be able to have dinner at home more often.</p>

		<p>Finally.. after a couple of hours of labour pain.. I&#8217;ve upggraded to the latest Rails, upgraded Rssfwd (now non-english characters appear nicely in the email From and Subject! Yippie!), and finally upgraded my blog to use <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/">Typo</a> (a blog app written with Rails). So much for forcing myself to learn PHP by installing Plog *<span style="font-style: italic;">sheepish</span>*. Moreover, at the rate Rails is picking momentum Typo is sure to benefit and getting many fun integration with the latest-kewl-thing.<br/><br/>So, when I get rested, perhaps I&#8217;ll personalise the layout etc.. (this default one looks rather good actually.. but Love misses her old layout)<br/><br/>Sorry if I&#8217;d broken some of your rss aggregator&#8217;s subscription..
