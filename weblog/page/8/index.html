		<p> <p>Sprained my lower-back last monday and have been out of action ever since. I&#8217;d known but never truely appreciated the fact that the back muscles play such an important role in everyday activities - waking up (this is a tough one), bathing, sneezing (urgh!), walking, sitting, standing, sleeping&#8230; everything!<br /> <br /> I <em>could</em> do them all eventually, but really really slowly. Exploring every move and experimenting how to do them without using my back. One wrong move and the back just go into a spasm. And since the body isn&#8217;t conditioned to do those tasks the new way, the muscles feels tense and tire very easily. Not fun.<br /> <br /> The weather apparently took pity on my immobilized state: just so that I won&#8217;t miss the sunshine too much, it had rained continuously ever since.<br /> <br /> Nevertheless, 2006 has been wonderful to me, and its gonna get better in 2007! (Hopefully my new <a href="http://www.omazz.com/">omazz</a> will contribute to a better back!) So, have a good year everyone!<br /> <br /> </p> <blockquote>&quot;<em>I have a feeling we are about to embark on a most unprecedented expedition!</em>&quot;<br /> - Bill (&amp; Ted)</blockquote> <p>Note: The funniest charade I&#8217;ve seen must&#8217;ve been for &quot;<em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0096928">Bill &amp; Ted&#8217;s Excellent Adventure</a></em>&quot;.

		<p> <p>Yea, yea&#8230; I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/On-Intelligence-Jeff-Hawkins/dp/0805074562">On Intelligence</a> and read all about the &quot;blind man seeing with his tongue&quot; experiment.. but this (the illness and the story) is still incredibulous:</p> <blockquote> <p>As regular readers of my blog know, I lost my voice about 18 months ago. Permanently. It&rsquo;s something exotic called Spasmodic Dysphonia&#8230; </p><p>The weirdest part of this phenomenon is that speech is processed in different parts of the brain depending on the context. So people with this problem can often sing but they can&rsquo;t talk. In my case I could do my normal professional speaking to large crowds but I could barely whisper and grunt off stage. And most people with this condition report they have the most trouble talking on the telephone or when there is background noise. I can speak normally alone, but not around others. That makes it sound like a social anxiety problem, but it&rsquo;s really just a different context, because I could easily sing to those same people&#8230;</p><p>Then something happened. My brain remapped. My speech returned. </p> </blockquote> <p>- Mr Dilbert, <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/10/good_news_day.html">http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/10/good_news_day.html</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Wow!

		<p>Mihai Parparita has done it again. Not only did he author my favourite (and prettiest) Greasemonkey script: <a href="http://persistent.info/archives/2005/12/23/greasemonkey">Gmail Macros</a>, he has now gone ahead and <a href="http://persistent.info/archives/2006/10/13/google-reader-redux">integrated Google Reader with Gmail</a>, using only <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a>.<br /></p><p>Btw, talk about &quot;<em>throw it against the wall and see what sticks</em>&quot;&#8230; Greasemonkey is probably one of the best enabler of such technique!<br /></p><p>I&#8217;ve imported all my <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/">RssFwd</a> subscriptions over to Google Reader to try out Mihai&#8217;s Gmail Reader. So far so good. A few kinks here and there (e.g. unread Feeds doesn&#8217;t bold like other labels, Gmail Macros can&#8217;t go to Feeds with &#8216;G, F&#8217; keystroke) but no show-stopper, and definitely nothing an official integration wouldn&#8217;t fix - if there is one.<br /></p><p>There are differences between using RssFwd + Gmail and Google Reader + Gmail. In the former, content is &quot;in your hands&quot;. Emails are plain old emails. Take them anywhere, filter them, fwd them, do anything to them. We&#8217;ve had emails for donkey years now, there must be at least a hundred tricks you can do with emails - and none of them requires any new features from anybody. </p><p>On the other hand, Google Reader (like most RSS readers) will need to work towards making such tools/features available. The lack of features that we take for granted in the good&#8217;ol email makes the content in such readers feel more&#8230; transient in comparison.</p><p>I guess its just a matter of what suits you. For me, I&#8217;m giving myself sometime to see if this Gmail Reader usage pattern groove with me :-)</p><p>PS: What/How long does it take for Google to officially integrate <a href="http://persistent.info/archives/2005/03/01/gmail-searches">Persistent Search</a> &amp; Gmail Macros? Just do it already! *sigh*<br /></p>

		<p>There was some serious discussion and division of household duties this afternoon over a nice meal at Soup Restaurant. The meeting ended with me taking on the Washing, whereas Love landed the Ironing duties. Though her gleam made me suspicious that I got the shorter end of the stick, my spider sense predicts otherwise. </p><p>Washing is mostly braindead labor and logistics, hence has room to be automated further. Whereas, Ironing is an intricate process of pressing something hot on delicate materials - this requires attention and spans the whole process.<br /><br />Also, history is on my side. The Ironing equipment might have improved from coals to electric/steam, but the process has hardly changed. On the other hand, Washing has come a long way from beating a stick beside the river, to scrubbing with washboards, to now - sitting beside the machine reading a book.<br /></p><p>A high-end <a href="http://store.irobot.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=2174932&amp;cp=2174940">roomba</a> is slated to be making its rounds in the house every day (its noisy, so only while we&#8217;re out at work). No cooking will take place, hence plates washing &amp; other kitchen duties will be bare minimal.</p><p>In our pursuit to set up a least-maintenance-accomodation, I think we&#8217;re just left with finding a solution for curtains: No dark panes, no monthly washing / dusting, no troublesome hooks nor heavy drapes. Hmm.<br /> </p><p>Its great that both of us are lazy. Goals align naturally where there&#8217;s least resistance.<br /></p>

		<p> <p>Vitamin has an article about <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/design/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-designers">understanding &amp; working with designers</a>. I&#8217;m not sure I took away anything other than knowing I&#8217;m not alone afterall. </p> <p>The gap between the creative and developers is actually quite substantial. If I could naively reduce the problem down to tools, then this analogy could succintly describe the issue: You are tasked to co-author a book using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar">Wordstar2000</a>  with somebody using Microsoft <strike>Word</strike> Powerpoint - somewhere along the line, one party will need to close that gap. In this part of the world, more often than not, its the developers that closes this gap (not always doing a good job, me included). Otherwise, the designer and developer will be the same person. That&#8217;s where you get flash-only websites (those that lets you click <em>Skip flash presentation</em> using a flash button), and <a href="http://freshmeat.net/">freshmeat.net</a>.<br /></p> <p>A site&#8217;s design is  carefully thought out, planned and template pages are created, &quot;<em>here&#8217;s the main page, inner pages, forms and blah. now, go forth and multiply!&quot;</em>. The programmer takes this goodie bag of hair, nose, eyes, ears and proceeds to construct the face.. do some code to make it blink&#8230; sprinkle the eyes here.. do some code for smiling&#8230; plaster the lips there&#8230; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugly_Bob">voila</a>! At this point, the creative side has 2 options, iterate over the design or throw his hands up and the product ships. </p> <p>Through iteration, hopefully the programmer learns design better and designer understands technical constraints better. You&#8217;d think that after many iterations, projects after projects, this gap ought to come pretty close right? Strangely, it often doesn&#8217;t. We all know programmers has no taste, so that&#8217;s a dead end. And I know of online marketing companies that has designated &quot;<em>html cutters</em>&quot; (in case you can&#8217;t picture it, their fulltime job is to take a piece of museum-ready artwork done by the creatives, and html-ize it. Man&#8230; )<br /> </p> <p>What will it take for the situation to improve?<br /> </p> <p>Few months back, during RailsConf, I had the good fortune to chat with Bryan Wood of <a href="http://www.lendmonkey.com/">Lendmonkey</a>. He related to me how great the process was to work with <a href="http://www.slash7.com/">Amy Hoy</a> for their Railsday project: <a href="http://www.slash7.com/articles/2006/06/21/railsday-railsconf">Freckle</a>.<br /> </p> <ol> <li>Start coding up some pages, forms and the skeleton app<br /> </li> <li>Commit the files into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software)">repository</a>. <br /> </li> <li>Continue to work on the applications (like, erm, make it actually work)</li> <li>Time to time, synchronize your code with the repository</li> <li>After a while, during one of the updates, lots of files and images are downloaded&#8230; you refresh your page and <em>WOAH!</em> Your web app looks pretty!<br /> </li> </ol> <p>This 5 bullet points covers the web development process from the developer&#8217;s point of view. A designer that closes the gap. Sounds surreal to me. A dream come true. I have <a href="http://www.43things.com/things/view/1003249">never seen</a> it in action.<br /> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p>
