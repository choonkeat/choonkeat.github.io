		<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted that feature. Very helpful when doing javascript development&#8230; So I was delighted when I saw <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/archives/2005/08/view_postrender.html">View Post-rendered Source</a>, that there&#8217;s a plugin to do it! That&#8217;s helpful!<br/>
<br/>
Then I read the first comment from bubu,<br/>
<blockquote>hmm, if you select some text in Firefox, and press right button of mouse and choose there View Selection Source, then it will to show generated html source (e.g. modified with javascript), not that wich is downloaded from server.<br/>
</blockquote> <br/>
I guess I just <i>assumed</i> nobody did such thing to bother searching *sigh* Great work <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/">Firefox</a>! <br/>
<br/>
PS: Talking about Javascript.. <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/articles/2005/08/07/functional-web-application-testing-with-automatic-recording">I&#8217;d talked about</a> recording web apps before whilst experiencing testing pains rushing for my earlier projects. Now it looks like somebody did a <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/articles/2005/08/07/functional-web-application-testing-with-automatic-recording">javascript-based record-what-you-did</a> framework for functional testing. Good potential, as long as it works even on relatively javascript-twisted apps! But I must say.. it needs to couple with http conversation recording to truely kickass&#8230;<br/></p>

I don&#8217;t suppose its designer quality yet. But at least it doesn&#8217;t look as sloppy as before. Now, that I&#8217;ve gotten that out of the door - time to do some cool useful features!<br/>

		<p>This guy just keeps coming, shooting and hitting. Paul Graham&#8217;s OSCON keynote speech, &quot;<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html">What Business Can Learn From Open Source</a>&quot;. Good stuff to read for <span style="font-weight: bold;">everyone</span> (not open source only, nor software-only).<br/>
<br/>
I tried to cut snippets to put here&#8230; but each para is just full of stuff its unfair to (paste anything here and) leave anything behind!&#8230; I&#8217;ll just copy some random para now, don&#8217;t take it as any hint of the gist of his speech:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><br />
Meetings are like an opiate with a network effect. So is email, on a smaller scale. And in addition to the direct cost in time, there&#8217;s the cost in fragmentation&#8211; breaking people&#8217;s day up into bits too small to be useful.<br/>
<br/>
You can see how dependent you&#8217;ve become on something by removing it suddenly. So for big companies I propose the following experiment. Set aside one day where meetings are forbidden&#8211; where everyone has to sit at their desk all day and work without interruption on things they can do without talking to anyone else. Some amount of communication is necessary in most jobs, but I&#8217;m sure many employees could find eight hours worth of stuff they could do by themselves. You could call it &#8220;Work Day.&#8221;</blockquote><br />

		<p>When I first found Perl, coming from C/Java world&#8230; I fell in love with it. Writing in perl was snappy. No beatin&#8217; them round those bushes when looking for money:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>open(FILE, &quot;bushes.txt&quot;);<br/>
while (&lt;FILE&gt;) {<br/>
&nbsp; printf if (/money/); # prints all lines that has &#8216;money&#8217; in it.. <br/>
}<br/>
close FILE;<br/>
</blockquote> <br/>
Fresh from school of C/C++, I&#8217;d never <span style="font-style: italic;">knew</span> working with files was so easy and concise! Then came the real addictive @arrays.. <a href="http://www.pageresource.com/cgirec/ptut11.htm">push, pop, split, join, each, splice</a>,&#8230; life was good! (and I haven&#8217;t even mentioned %hashes!) In fact, it was so good I started writing myself helper classes in Java just so I can <span style="font-style: italic;">think</span> naturally - and giving runtime performance the middle finger, &quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">Development time costs more than CPU cycles</span>&quot; I&#8217;d say and only did optimisation when there&#8217;s production need - which turns out rarer than I&#8217;d expected. Not all of us work in million-hits-per-second mega online store. And as history goes, Java did eventually come cosy up with <span style="font-style: italic;">split</span> as well. Only split. <br/>
<br/>
And when I first saw Ruby it was the <span style="font-style: italic;">each</span> syntax that caught my eye. I could only say OMG! But Martin Fowler has articulated <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CollectionClosureMethod.html">the power combo of closures and collections [very good read]</a> very well. Even recently as I was showing <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/07/08/new-rails-movie-with-sound-and-sugar/">The Rails video</a> to some colleagues, I find myself repeating this disclaimer each time: <span style="font-style: italic;">Oh, this [benefit] is Ruby - not Rails per se - a scripting language&#8217;s arrays is always more powerful</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Was at a Java event a few months back where the presenter was talking about Java 1.5 features. Most of the stuff were so-so to me, until he said something like (not quoting here): <span style="font-style: italic;">We did not introduce a &#8216;foreach&#8217; keyword because we&#8217;re very careful not to break existing codes,&#8230; </span>then goes on to introduce the new <span style="font-style: italic;">enum </span>keyword. Duh. How is <span style="font-style: italic;">foreach </span>more probable to break existing codes than <span style="font-style: italic;">enum</span>? I&#8217;d even bet its totally the other way round.<br/>
<br/>
Btw I haven&#8217;t investigated <span style="font-style: italic;">enum</span>, but my gut feel tells me - its an unnecessarily complex beast that is only waiting to contribute to <a href="http://www.antipatterns.com/thebook.htm">anti-patterns</a>.<br/>
<br/>
enum. foreach. I can&#8217;t understand <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2004/11/22/pet-peeves-and-java">why the priorities are such</a>. really.<br/>
<br/>
update: yea, I know the stuff mentioned above were wee bit outdated. but reading martin fowler did me in. i&#8217;m hoping <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/22/145210&from=rss">an open source movement</a> will put enough pressure to steer the language&#8217;s priorities.<br/>
<br/>
update: its my hypothesis that a language needs only to provide good grammer for list and strings (includes regex) to be useful. runtime performance should be dealt with aside of grammar.</p>

		<p><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/up_or_down.php">Jason on 37signals</a> asked:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Up or down? Blogs usually have the latest post on top and the older posts on the bottom&#8230; Blog comment sections usually have the latest comment on the bottom and the older comments on top&#8230; What is it about quick conversations like comments and chats that favor the latest on the bottom, yet more static conversations &mdash; such as blog posts and emails &mdash; prefer the newest on top?</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Absolutely nothing about quick or slow interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Input submission area is bottom, so the latest is at the bottom for referencing. Same goes for IM. Anything with input. In fact, put the input area on top, and the arrangement will be magically assumed to be latest-on-top.<br/>
<br/>
In traditional email apps, &quot;compose new&quot; is a new window (not relative to the location of inbox), even if it is positioned relatively, rarely any sent mail gets appended into the inbox. In gmail however, the threading is latest-bottom. Bottom, where the input area is.<br/>
<br/>
Without the above requirement, latest-on-top will be the only naturally efficient arrangement. Less code (no auto-scroll down), less effort (for reader to scroll). Hence blogs, inbox and many other things are arranged latest-on-top.<br/></p>
