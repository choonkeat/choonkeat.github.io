		<p>For a lack of better phrase, and I don&#8217;t know who started this - just that I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags">saw it on Flickr first</a> - I&#8217;ve shamelessly copied the presentation of my &quot;List Of Sites&quot; into Flickr-style, instead of the old, boring, usual, row-by-row listing..  *yawns*.. anyways, <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/">check it out</a>! [Updated link on 26 Apr &#8216;06]<br /><br />Think I may just put the &quot;You may also like.. &quot; feature soon.. <br /><br />Btw, I&#8217;m currently using the following MySQL query to rank the feeds -<br /><br />SELECT<br /><div style="margin-left: 40px">FLOOR(<br /><div style="margin-left: 40px">SUM(<br /><div style="margin-left: 40px">my.num_of_subscribers &gt; your.num_of_subscribers OR <br />(my.num_of_subscribers = your.num_of_subscribers AND my.id &gt; your.id)</div>) / COUNT(*) * 25) + 6 AS rank, </div>SUBSTRING(my.title, 1, 15) AS abbr_title, <br />my.* </div>FROM <br /><div style="margin-left: 40px">feeds my, feeds your <br /></div>WHERE <br /><div style="margin-left: 40px">my.id != your.id AND my.title != &#8221; </div>GROUP BY my.id <br />ORDER BY my.title ASC;<br /><br />That&#8217;s a mouthful!.. Roughly translate to: <span style="font-style: italic">More subscribers always more popular; if not, newer is more popular</span>. <br /><ul><li>rank: The &quot;/ count(*) &#8230; as rank&quot; is just to make sure that the range is 6 to 31 (font-ready numbers that I can plug directly in the rhtml file)</li><li>abbr_title: not in use yet.. was going to control, because some ppl&#8217;s blog titles are just too damn long! :-D</li></ul>I couldn&#8217;t really decide what to do with the feeds that has the same number of subscribers (which happens to be &#8216;1&#8217; in many cases&#8230;) so I chose the lazy option: give the wildcard rankings to new feeds (order by id) so that the rankings will shuffle as new feeds are added - which is likely, since somebody out there is always reading something else.. If I&#8217;d given the wildcard rankings to the more frequently updated, then the ranking would&#8217;ve been rather stagnant - personal blogs will never outdo news sites, and news sites has naturally more chance of gaining subscriptions.<br /></p>

		<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Customer</span>: Here. Keys to the replacement car.<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><br />Manufacturer</span>: Thank you, and your keys. Your car is repaired and you may drive her home now.<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><br />Customer</span>: Thanks. You know.. actually I like your replacement car better. It drives better.<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><br />Manufacturer</span>: But, they&#8217;re different models. *courteous smile* You can&#8217;t compare two of different generations.<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><br />Customer</span>: I know its a real old model.. but the steering is snappy, engine starts when I turn the key - and check this out - the speedo meter doesn&#8217;t hang on me from time to time.<br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Manufacturer</span>: Yes, people usually say that about old models. *wider smile* <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">But</span> your new car gives you a real-time GPS map, plays MP3 and you can even choose from over 84 polyphonic car-horn tunes.<br /><br />What a fictitious, improbable piece of crappy dialog? Well, change the context to a mobile phone, and that&#8217;s what just took place last night at the LG service centre. No.. no big qualm about LG - they make good fridge (I think) - just some pet peeves about mobile phones in general. When I mentioned I actually prefer the replacement phone during tea-time yesterday, my colleagues readily agreed with me that (not only LG you see) old phone models are better <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">phones</span>. And, these are not your <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">uncle/aunty</span> colleagues, mind you. Message him &quot;<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">You free?</span>&quot; on Yahoo! Messenger and he could well reply &quot;<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Driving.</span>&quot;<br /><br />Why are things this way? Is it an acceptable fact-of-life that new generation, smarter phones are generally lousier phones.. albeit with more features? Can&#8217;t newer things do the old stuff just as well? If not better?? Change the context to cars and suddenly,.. you get a really silly trend.<br /><br />You see, that&#8217;s because the software is crap. I&#8217;m a software engineer and I say again it is crap! Software is most crap when they&#8217;re not designed to serve the main purpose of their existence. Ah! But a software has <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">so</span> many purposes, that&#8217;s why its so hard to make one that doesn&#8217;t suck you see? For every idiot you find, you&#8217;ll get 10 different opinions on what a device should do. The pitfall is, when you cater to all of them, you cater to none. Even Dash got it right - &quot;[Everyone is special] Its like saying nobody is.&quot;<br /><br />So, I&#8217;ll be an idiot and I&#8217;ll say mine, because this is my blog and I&#8217;m host today. Let&#8217;s talk about mobile phones since its close to heart (being in my pockets, its actually closer to <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">there</span>). I don&#8217;t know about yours, so I&#8217;ll talk about mine. I mean my <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">PHONE</span>, you sicko. Mobile phones are multi-purpose devices, so let&#8217;s give them the fair appraisal as different devices, of a different purpose each.<br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Make a call, pick up a call</span> - Fail this, and your phone is a just PDA. Luckily, most phones get the simplicity of this correct. With screen size these days, anything that scolls long names across the screen should be shot. If I can search-as-I-type the address book, why can&#8217;t I search-as-I-type the recently-dialled list? Want a phone for your mum? Buy Samsung. Why? The font is bigger when dialing. Why can&#8217;t all other manufacturers just have bigger dialing fonts? Btw, Samsung does have bigger dialing buttons too, but that&#8217;s hardware - discussion for another day.<br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Add/Search the address book</span> - Nobody I know ever goes to &quot;Menu &gt; Addressbook &gt; Add&quot; anymore, they just dial the other party and later Add from the recent-dialled list. Why? Why does all &quot;Add&quot; menu ask for the name first when the number is the more volatile and forgettable? And some think its even important you decide SIM or Phone Memory first, duh? And if I only always get to see these same first few contacts everytime I open up the addressbook, why does it still have to re-read from my SIM - you mean I can change SIM card on-the-fly? Or is its a prelude to the next model&#8217;s iPodShuffle-the-addressbook feature? In fact, while I&#8217;m at caching, can&#8217;t the SMS Inbox cache the first page of messages for me to open up the Inbox fast?<br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Send/Receive Messages</span> - This one, I think, Nokia has nailed it <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">eons</span> ago. Its only beyond me why all other manufacturers simply refuse to repeat their success (Or is there a patent on menu sequences?). And, when a new message arrive, 1-button and show it! Don&#8217;t <strong><em>EVER</em></strong> take me to the Inbox list! Periodically &quot;Delete All&quot; your Inbox? &quot;No more space for new messages&quot;? The phone can&#8217;t handle large list of messages? How about softening that defect of your phone by introducing a &quot;Reply &amp; Delete&quot; menu? Message Replied? Deleted? Take me out! What are the chances that after replying to a message, that I wish to read it again? Or after deleting a new message, do I wish to look at any of the large list of messages in Inbox that I&#8217;d chosen not to delete previously? You&#8217;re already a so-slow-processor, don&#8217;t waste my time doing these unnecessary cpu-intensive next page.<br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Taking/Browsing pictures</span> - Simple rule of thumb: 1-Button. Ok? Programs should be pre-loaded once the phone is turned on (Ok, its trying, but I hope!). Then accessing them will be a flash - a task switch, not an application startup. If I choose &quot;Camera&quot;, and only then do you start the application - the girl has already gone away!<br /><br />And when any manufacturer finally gets everything right, for the sake of evolution, will the rest just kindly follow? <br /><br /><br /></p>

		<p>[<strong>Updated: </strong>It turns out the login page was a little hiccup (apparently my account only?) that&#8217;s been fixed. The sharing was already designed to be as described below. Cheers Jason. Below is the original post and comments. ]</p><p>Nice app, <a href="http://www.tadalist.com/">Tadalist</a> (see short, quicktime <a href="http://www.tadalist.com/theater">demo</a>)&#8230; very simple app that does what it does well, and I have some feedback on the sharing of lists. I tried sharing my list with someone else (not a user of tadalist.com). This someone-else received an email with a randomly-generated link to click. When he clicks, (to my dismay) he&#8217;s lead to a login page. From the looks of it, (to my utter dismay) its <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">my</span> login page.<br /><br />So, a few things here.. first, I&#8217;d assume the observation is a bug - when the somebody-else doesn&#8217;t have an account yet, he shouldn&#8217;t get my login screen - right? Secondly, why only account user-to-account user sharing?<br /><br />Since a unique URL is already generated, why not based on this unique URL, give the visitor an identifying session (note the email for accountability) and allow the visitor to add, edit, and check items off this list without requiring him to be an account holder of the system?<br /><br />Won&#8217;t this be a kewler sharing - totally non-binding to whether the somebody-else has an account in the system or not? I mean, tadalist.com isn&#8217;t about personal-details harvesting right (<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">tell me it ain&#8217;t so!</span>).. so why require it? By dropping this <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">little</span> requirement, tadalist would have a fighting chance to <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000332.html">spread</a> <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/fog0000000162.html">virally</a>.<br /><br />Also, with the unique-url-can-edit openness, I can put my project-deadline tadalist as my wallpaper (activedesktop), and so can everyone else on my team.<br /><br /></p><br />

Just a few days I never tune in then <a href="http://class95.mediacorpradio.com/classmdt.htm">Morning Express</a> (arguably <a href="http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/1997/09/sne_part_1.html">the best morning radio show in Singapore</a>) closing shop liao?

If you&#8217;re still making expensive overseas call, but you and the other party is a <a href="http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2005/01/your_ingterneck.html">totally internet capable aunt y lilly</a> then you should give your pocket a break and <a href="http://www.skype.com/">download Skype now</a>.
