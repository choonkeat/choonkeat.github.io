		<p>Rails has released an updated video (see previous video <a href="http://media.nextangle.com/rails/rails_setup.mov">here</a>),&nbsp; originally prepared for a conference presentation. So the audio you hear is actually from the presenter trying to <span style="font-weight: bold;">catch up</span> with what David is typing in his silent movie.<br/>
<br/>
All web developers should view it: <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/media/video/rails_take2_with_sound.mov">HERE</a> (15 minutes video). And maybe we should run a quiz for watching the video clip like: How many things can you spot him not being <span style="font-weight: bold;">required</span> to do? <br/>
<br style="font-style: italic;"/><br />
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;aiyah..I deen install quick time&quot;</span><br style="font-style: italic;"/><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;install. its fucking worth it.&quot;</span><br/>

I hope nay sayers realise, its time to say goodbye to some &quot;commodity&quot; practices. Its been, what 10 over years? of web development.. isn&#8217;t it time to <span style="font-style: italic;">move on</span>? Why are we still haggling over trivial design decisions like foreign key naming?<br/>
<br/>
Time to leave such stuff to the framework. And <span style="font-style: italic;">move on</span>.<br/></p>

		<p>Apparently <a href="http://operawatch.blogspot.com/2005/07/opera-adds-support-for-bit-torrent.html">Opera browser is embedding</a> a Bittorrent client in its next version. Kewl. Hopefully other browsers follow suit.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#8217;s it. Until web servers becomes Bittorrent capable themselves, Bittorrent will remain more a software than a protocol. Otherwise, it&#8217;ll be smooth and transparent like <a href="http://webreference.com/internet/software/servers/http/compression/3.html">HTTP compression headers</a> that most of us already benefit from without even realising its there.<br/>
<br/>
And from the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/bramcohen/6531.html">bickering</a>, looks like nothing is going to change (Maybe it&#8217;ll take a MS implementation to Apache into action?).<br/></p>

		<p>Just the other night, I was with Love when she was clearing her gmail - *click* on the checkbox of the third (or so) email, scrolled hastily down (she&#8217;s quite a speed reader), *shift-clicked* on the checkbox several rows down and the inbetween emails got their checkboxes selected as well.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Eh? Wait! What did you do?.. Did you just hold the shift key?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Ya..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In disbelief, I tried. It works. *gasp*. Shift-click. Like I&#8217;ve seen it the first time. I mean, I know it works on usual desktop stuff shift-click to select a range of stuff&#8230; but webpages / checkboxes isn&#8217;t supposed to be capable of that.. I mean.. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Duh&quot;, Love rolled her eyes and continued to slaughter her inbox. Now, I&#8217;m dumb.<br/></p>

		<p>Finally got around to fix the Rssfwd bookmarklet (wasn&#8217;t working on Internet Explorer). Now it does, and also tested on Firefox and Opera 8.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#8217;ve added a tiny rssfwd icon/link thing to make <a href="http://blog.uwinnipeg.ca/schwagbag/archives/2005/05/post_1.html">site owner&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/archives/2005/05/17/cool_shifted_scsu_services.html">lives easier</a>.. no more hoops to jump to make your site subscribe-able. Just include a little picture like this:<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;"><br />
<br/><a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/powered_by"><img border="0" src="http://rails.yanime.org/subscribe_via_rssfwd.png" alt="Click to subscribe for email updates"/></a></div><br />
<br/>
Also.. fixed a big stupid bug. I didn&#8217;t know feed detection failed on XHTML compliant websites. Duh. Things should just work now. Lemme know if anything thing doesn&#8217;t.<br/>
<br/>
Also.. I just found some enterprising folks <a href="http://starting-a-businessx.blogspot.com/2005/04/bringing-back-nfl-could-be-bargain-for.html">using Rssfwd to push content to their site</a>. Heh. I&#8217;m still undecided whether that&#8217;s a good thing or bad thing. I guess good.<br/>

PS: Not done with my pick-a-VPS-hosting-plan yet. This is taking much longer than I thought.<br/></p>

		<p>A small, agile Singapore-based company that I know of has just started using <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> to manage 2 of their latest, biggest projects. Their technical lead is also checking out Ruby and more importantly, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. This is a company doing their projects with <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2005/06/14/wrong-fight">Java on LAMP</a>. Perfect fit.<br/>

I know pockets of companies has been <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hiring+rails+developers">picking up Rails developers</a>..

		<p>For those interested in Web Services, and thinking what the f is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a> all hyped about? Jon Udell has a great <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/06/14.html#a1250">article</a> that answers questions like:<br/>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br/>
&quot;&#8230;got me to thinking about why we (that&#8217;s you and me &#8211; Web users) are OK with degraded user experiences. I mean, for years we had great desktop applications to do things like calendaring and email and even mapping software&#8230; And now we&#8217;re all very excited about things like Evite, Gmail, and Google maps. But compare Google Maps to Streets and Trips, which I did recently, and the experience with S&amp;T is much better&#8230;&quot;<br/>

<br/>
This is also reason to believe that fat-client will never dispose of thin-client, regardless of how much $$ is pushing it. Because <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/03/04/10OPstrategic_1.html">Web DNA and no Windows tax</a> is more fun.<br/>

		<p><a href="http://news.zdnet.com/Open-source+LAMP+a+beacon+to+developers/2100-3513_22-5744767.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdnn">LAMP is good?</a> You agree? I agree. My last 3 companies are all on LAMP. The LAMP combo (<span style="font-weight: bold;">L</span>inux, <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>pache, <span style="font-weight: bold;">M</span>ySQL, <span style="font-weight: bold;">P</span>HP/Perl/Python)&nbsp; powered countless dotcoms (and many ISVs even now) and is accepted by most folks as a decent and cheap server setup. Good starting point?<br/>
<br/>
Even Java folks are comfortable to acknowledge, &quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">LAMP is an enabling, agile combo, but for enterprise systems [insert keywords of scalability,&nbsp; web services, BEPL]..</span>.&quot; whatever.. so, bottom line is LAMP is not necessarily <i>excellent</i>, but <span style="font-weight: bold;">good enough</span>?<br/>
<br/>
Also, agree with me that its kewl to replace the &quot;P&quot; with basically anything you like aye? Some people like Perl. Some people prefer Python. Agree? Whichever the case, LAMP is LAMP - its light, cheap (free!) and good. Oh! and some will add Tomcat, and use Java - LAM* <span style="font-style: italic;">bah!</span> - still the same: light, cheap and good. Agree?<br/>
<br/>
Why then, may I ask, that when I mention <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a> does the <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/04/1520227&amp;from=rss">weather look <span style="font-style: italic;">different</span></a>? Can it scale? Does it support 2-phase commits? Transactions? Speed? Sheesh. Now when did those demeaning questions pop up in discussions of LAMP? I just changed the &quot;P&quot; didn&#8217;t I? LAMP is still LAMP? Or is it now no more?<br/>
<br/>
In fact, its a LAMP+ (read: plus a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22nobody+has+done+it+like+this%22+rails">thought out development framework</a>, out of the box, ready for use)<br/>
<br/>
Now LAMP doesn&#8217;t come with a framework - that missing last mile? - build your own, collect, assemble into what your team of developers can use to churn out web applications after web applications.. lemme see, where do we-the-new-startup begin? Ok, let&#8217;s do&#8230; The Login framework! oh yes, we need some database wrappers that we can - <span style="font-style: italic;">check this out</span> - reuse! DIY. BYO. Yay!<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#8217;d figure what the difference is - wrong fight. Any discussion on Rails leading to J2EE and scaling should be henceforth be halted, stopped - not a word spoken more. Instead, civil discussions should come from the angle of &quot;Why choose LAMP and start with zero?&quot; After you&#8217;d install LAMP you can&#8217;t groovy yet.. but after you have installed Rails, it would&#8217;ve scaffolded you high enough to develop those apps, <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/20/rails.html">straightaway</a>. Any new adopters to LAMP should be rescued from Web1.0 hazards, and nourished in Rails.<br/>
<br/>
PS: It is often easier to scale up, than scale down. And when one tries to scale down its kitchen sink (i.e. become agile) - they <a href="http://www.bea.com/framework.jsp?CNT=index.htm&amp;FP=/content/products/aqualogic/#">gotta throw it all away</a>. Now, why would you want to scale down? Go figure - only thing is, when you do, just don&#8217;t start from zero.<br/>
