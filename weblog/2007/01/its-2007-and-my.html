	<div class="entry-content"><p>Fact: There have been <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000223.php">USB chargers</a> for phones for sometime now. And fact: most phones come bundled with cables to connect to the computer too. (You&#8217;ll have to <em>separately</em> install some terribly unfriendly, proprietary software to manage your phone or sync with something draconian like Outlook. But that&#8217;s kinda expected from handset makers.)<br /> </p><p>Also fact: Most users don&#8217;t connect their phones to a computer (Yes, you do. But I said most). Most important fact: But everyone charges their phone. My mom does. So it must be everyone. Why isn&#8217;t there <em>any</em> effort to piggyback data connection onto this compulsary user activity, aka ritual? To segway more users to connect their phones and computers&#8230; like PDAs?<br /></p><p>For years (years!), PDAs comes with something known as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle">cradle</a>. PDAs sit in it to charge its battery - and with a usability sleight-of-hand, it&#8217;s also connected to a computer. So what you say? An <em>uncountable</em> number of PDA applications are out there (freeware, shareware, commercial software) totally relying on their users putting those handhelds into the cradle - the consistent, daily ritual! I remember, in my Palm wielding days, AvantGo is a really defacto application to install (offline news reading), and Showtimes! keeps my weekly movie schedules handy wherever I go&#8230; so many internet-related applications&#8230; and the handhelds themselves weren&#8217;t even network capable then! How crazy is that!!? </p><p>(Btw, I could have any PDA sit in its cradle for hours - charging is &quot;managed&quot;. No big deal. What&#8217;s with the <em>don&#8217;t over charge your phone</em> thing? Mobiles are lame? Or just urban legend?)<br /></p><p>Just gimmie 1 USB cable. </p><p>This USB cable (&quot;sync cable&quot;) connects to my PC on one end, and my phone on the other. This is the phone&#8217;s &quot;cradle&quot;. It charges the phone with USB power while and revealing the phone as a thumbdrive to the computer. Using the most fundamental, cross-platform, desktop interface: files and folders. SMS, contacts, MMS, images, videos? Everything. Only files and folders. (Note: Any required software is installed through the USB&#8217;s drive, no separate install CD please!)<br /></p><p>In the phone, let&#8217;s have a launcher application called &quot;Mothership&quot;. Now, &quot;Mothership&quot; will launch other (registered) applications whenever the phone is in such &quot;cradle&quot; (similar to &quot;<em>start this application when Windows start</em>&quot; in the Windows world). So we now have a &quot;cradle&quot; equivalent for a phone: When the phone is charging, some applications are launched to perform syncs and what not.<br /> </p><p>Wait, I&#8217;ve merely taped a USB charger cable (nothing new) and data sync cable (nothing new) together, provided a files &amp; folders interface on the PC (not new for some phones) and added a launcher event on the phone (Symbian developers can already detect &quot;charging&quot; event). What&#8217;s the big deal? </p><p>When &quot;Mothership&quot; launches an application, it automatically maps all network calls (3G, GPRS, whatever) of that application to use the computer&#8217;s internet connection! - i.e. effectively free internet connectivity. (<em>I&#8217;ve polled several Symbian programmers on technical possibility and the response is positive</em> ;-). So, with &quot;Mothership&quot;, the message to mobile developers is this: <em>No rewrite - if your program is launched by &quot;Mothership&quot;</em><em>, access to the Internet is automatically routed to use the PC&#8217;s connection</em>.<br /></p><p>Suddenly, a mobile podcast application looks more appealing - hey, just like an iPod synching. Sharing photos and videos becomes more seamless and free. A &quot;free&quot; network has been sorely missed in the mobile developers&#8217; world. This cradle thing should open up so many possibilities&#8230;<br /></p><p>Lots of usage edge cases? Maybe. But none that hasn&#8217;t been tackled by handhelds already, I suspect. And oh ya, &quot;sync cables&quot; should be sold cheaply, not for reaping huge profits. HOWTO build those cables, or tie up existing cables together, should be publicly available for DIY. <br /></p><p>Perhaps the impact of such connectivity can finally be brought home to the mobile world by somebody in the <a href="http://www.apple.com/">PDA / PC</a> world?<br /></p><p>Whoever it&#8217;ll be, please please make it happen soon&nbsp;</p>
