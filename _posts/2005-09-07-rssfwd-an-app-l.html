<p>It was exactly 300 days ago when <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2004/11/11/rssfwd-v0-1a">I started RssFwd</a>. Its wonderful how things turned out. Better stuff is in the works. Will post more about it soon. <br/>
<br/>
Btw, gotten a compliment today that <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd">RssFwd</a> is an example of the fabled <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/writeboard_the_appless_webapp.php">&quot;app-less&quot; web-app</a> in the sense that users doesn't go about &quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">using it</span>&quot;. I'd never thought of it this way. Kewl! RssFwd will always maintain its non-intrusive nature. It will always be about the publisher and the reader. RssFwd will never be about RssFwd.<br/>
<br/>
Also, 2 new features to announce, <br/>
<ol><br />
    <li>You can import your subscriptions from other aggregators (as long as you have an OPML file or url). Just visit the <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/import">Import Page</a>.</li><br />
    <li>As a publisher, you can track how many RssFwd subscriptions are there on your feed. Just use this API <span style="font-family: courier new;">/rssfwd/subscribers_count?url=[your rss url]</span> as an example, you can refer to <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/subscribers_count?url=http://blog.yanime.org/xml/rss/feed.xml">this URL</a> - it retrieves the number of subscribers I have for my rss feed.</li><br />
</ol><br />
As usual, feedback is greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
PS: Sorry, I'd forgotten who first asked for the OPML-import feature already. Whoever you are, sorry it took so long.<br/>
<br/>
PS: My prediction for <a href="http://www.writeboard.com/">37signals's Writeboard</a>? Super kewl ajax, css, in-place editing: click anywhere, type anything, no page reloads. 1 url for sharing and collab. <br/>
