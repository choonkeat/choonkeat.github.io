<p>Bitten by a 32-bit bug today when my colleague decided to have 3006 as his end-date in the database.... BOOM.</p>

<p>Apparently, the upper limit is closer than a thousand years. Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">2038</a> to be exact. Damn. That's within a lifetime.</p>

<p>Cold cold warning. Monkey-patched a few classes and the situation seem under control. We'll see. </p>
