<p>&quot;<em>Translate from [what] language to [what] language</em>&quot;</p>

<p>How odd. I go to any translation service, and that's what they'll ask me. More often than not, when I need a translation, I don't even know what language it is. Seriously, I really can't tell Portuguese from Spanish. </p>

<p>Here's a tool I wrote to help myself: <a href="http://dev.choonkeat.com/js/lang/index" title="Try and translate">try-anslator</a>.</p>

<p> It uses <a href="http://www.xrce.xerox.com/competencies/content-analysis/tools/guesser-ISO-8859-1.en.html">Xerox's Language Guesser</a> together with <a href="http://www.google.com.sg/language_tools?hl=en">Google Language tool</a>. (First choice <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/">Babelfish</a> went out of their way to stop programmers like me, so I stopped)</p>

<p>Its not the best translation in the world, but at least it gives me a good feel of what the text is talking about.. plus I see what language it was. Be gentle now, I'm not running on a dedicated machine.</p>
