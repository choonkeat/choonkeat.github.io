<p>Something's stumbled RssFwd earlier today (really should stop this practise of coding around 2-3am). Rssfwd was really quiet today (comparatively) and sending out quite little mails due to some very very stupid bug.<br/>
<br/>
I think I've gotten it nailed, and the mails/rss should flow as per normal after the next 2 hours. Once that settles, I'll continue with Rssfwd - OPML.<br/>
<br/>
Yea, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000052.html">let people out to get them in</a>...<br/></p>
