<a href="http://www.actual-exams.com/350-001-practice-exam.htm">350-001</a> as well as <a href="http://www.actual-exam
s.com/70-649-practice-exam.htm">70-649</a> are both difficult exams and a lot of preparation is needed. People tend to
 wait until the <a href="http://www.actual-exams.com">actual exam</a> itself before they start preparing for it. This 
is the reason why <a href="http://www.actual-exams.com/646-204-practice-exam.htm">646-204</a> professionals seldom fail in <a href="http://www.actual-exams.com/70-270-practice-exam.htm">70-270</a>.

<p>I'll be helping out in an event at the <a href="http://www.smu.edu.sg/">SMU</a> tomorrow afternoon - the launch of <a href="http://www.itsc.org.sg/prevEvent.do?eventKey=6"><em>code::XtremeApps::</em></a> - a 24hr programming competition in September. The 3 platforms of choice for participants are Ruby on Rails, Google Gadget and Google Toolkit. And there'll be a <a href="http://www.itsc.org.sg/prevEvent.do?eventKey=7">Rails crash course in 1st Sept</a>.</p>

<p>I'm quite happy to help bring awareness to Rails before the <em>more</em> mainstream locals (hat tip to Chin Chau). A breath of fresh air in the current curriculum of schools.</p>

<p>Peter Bohm (<a href="http://www.nextlogic.org/">NextLogic</a>) will be on stage selling Rails to the audience of potential participants while I try to act busy. I don't think he'll have much trouble. I hypothesize that you can actually find more Rails programmers in prison than in schools here thanks to his <a href="http://blog.nextlogic.net/articles/2007/07/27/corporate-trainings">training courses</a> ;-D</p>

<p>Anyways, if a competition whets your appetite or you happen to be near SMU, do drop by!</p>

<p>Update: Since some have asked, I need to clarify that my "prison" statement above was referring to Peter running a training course in the Prison that teaches some of them Ruby on Rails programming. :-P</p>
