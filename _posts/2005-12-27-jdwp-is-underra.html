<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jpda/jdwp-spec.html">Java(TM) Debug Wire Protocol</a> allows a debugger to work from a different machine than the process itself. But that's just a technical benefit.</p><p>A server (e.g. <a href="http://www.jboss.com/products/jbossas">JBoss</a>) started up with JDWP enabled will be ready to be plugged-in for debugging anytime. An <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse IDE</a> holding a project's source code <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/faq/eclipse-faq.html#users_18">can connect to such servers anytime</a> and start a debugging session. The server is already running the binary classes, the IDE holds the source files.</p><p>Let's not treat is like a debugging session (sounds like an 'other thing to do'), take it as a development session...</p><p>Through a browser, the developer can go about his routine navigations *click* *click* and development *click*. When required, set a breakpoint in his source code (Eclipse) - back at the browser, do a form post, and Viola! the browser is kept spinning, JBoss comes to its knees, <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/os-ecbug/">Eclipse highlights the line-of-code</a> where we've paused and asks, '<em>The world awaits your wish, sire?</em>'</p><p>At this moment, you can inspect variable values, make changes to the source code and save - Eclipse will compile your code automatically and update the remote class for you. Then you click resume in Eclipse, and everything else springs back to life - with the changes taking effect. Change source codes, save, see effect. In rapid fire succession. JSP already auto-compiles, now I can do the same for controllers. I can live with that. <br /></p><p>I think app servers should come default in &quot;development mode&quot; with JDWP enabled (production install in enterprise setting always needs to be tuned anyways). Such things shouldn't be left to be discovered. Or am I missing something here? Or because JDWP doesn't handle <em>some</em> edge cases, so its not <em>good enough</em> to be turned on?<br /></p>
