<p>Perhaps it was all those <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/29/2122250&from=rss">re-surfaced old Apple ads</a>.. and <a href="http://nedron.net:6969/">watching them</a>. Or perhaps it was my colleague's comment - &quot;Apple holds the record for the number of cool inventions that never make it.&quot; (think he was refering more to Steve Jobs and his too-ahead-of-its-time tech failures, than Apple itself)<br /><br />Anyways, I shall hence be giving a little tour to <a href="http://del.icio.us/">Del.icio.us</a> today - Show Don't Tell.<br /><br />Not that I think that you folks have no brains to know how to use Del.icio.us... But just in case some of you <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">procrastinated</span> - like I did for too long - simply because the Del.icio.us site looks so.. (no offence there!) so plain... not that <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Google</span>-type of nice and plain, but rather a more <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">thats-all?-duh </span>plain.<br /><br />So here it is, something that I take away from using Del.icio.us. Not that its the only or even best way to use the service, but its valuable for me this way, and I hope you can find it valuable in your way as well. <br /><br /><a href="http://rails.yanime.org/_doc/delicious.html">See short tour [swf]</a> - the idea is to completely obsolete the old-way of using bookmarks. The new way allows me to see sync bookmarks at home and office without jumping through hoops.<br /><br />FYI, delicious bookmarks are shared for all to see.. so don't put ur dirty secrets there.<br /><br /><br /></p>
