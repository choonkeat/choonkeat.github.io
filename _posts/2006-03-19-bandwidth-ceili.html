<p>Its funny how things are business-as-usual, then suddenly I'm 17GB over my 50GB monthly quota and its just half a month! Wierd. So I've migrated to an unmetered hosting plan.<br /> </p><p>If anything breaks on <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/">RssFwd</a>, lemme know - my email is choonkeat at gmail.<br /> </p><p>For those interested in the source codes, coincidentally, RssFwd source code has migrated to use <a href="http://rubyforge.org/">Rubyforge</a>'s &quot;<em>new</em>&quot; SVN hosting yesterday as well. No <a href="http://www.edgewall.com/trac/">Trac</a> yet though.<br /> </p>
