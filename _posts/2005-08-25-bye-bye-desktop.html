<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">YES!!!!</span> My <span style="font-weight: bold;">Number 1</span> Gmail wishlist item has been fullfilled! I can now use Gmail for all emails! Even corporate mails!<br/>
<br/>
Why? Because I can now use Gmail to compose and <b>send out mails using my other email addresses</b>! So, once I get all emails to myname@work.com to be forwarded to my gmail.. I can send and receive them inside Gmail itself!! Now I can stop running yet-another memory-hogging email app  and get reeeeeal good email search. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> was my sweet escape from Outlook.... but Gmail takes up less RAM ;-D<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=20616">Login to Gmail &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Send mail as</a></blockquote> <br/>
<br/>
Wayyyyyy sweet :-D and yah, <a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2005/08/send_gmail_from.html">this is much sweeter</a> news than Google Talk itself, sadly. <br/>
<br/>
Update: Er... a wish on top of this wish, can the signatures the tagged to each outgoing email as well?<br />
<br/><br/>
Update: for the concerned, the gmail headers Return-Path: and Sender: states your gmail address.. Received: header indicates its been thru wproxy.gmail.com server.. Message-ID: carries @mail.gmail.com. Other end-user usage experience is smooth. i.e Those headers aren't normally displayed, and recipients can hit "Reply" normally, etc.</p>
