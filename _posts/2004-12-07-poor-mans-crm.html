<p> Sitting in the cold, cold data centre and supporting just-launched web-based systems isn't my idea of quality time. Calls pours in, asking about &quot;Can you help me check why user XXX isn't being directed to the YYY scenario?&quot;, &quot;What is user XXX's current status for YYY module?&quot;.. blah blah things you wonder why they never surfaced during UAT... I'm sure some of you will be familiar.<br /><br />What's a poor dude to do to help himself - if the app wasn't spec'd with CRM modules? Can't add in chunky libraries, can't restart server, or even dream about installing <a href="http://www.toadsoft.com/">TOAD</a>.... <br /><br />All you need is 1 x JSP file.<br /><br />For all you poor souls standing in cold datacentres, wielding unfriendly Solaris terminals with touchpads and lousy <a href="http://www.uwp.edu/academic/mis/baldwin/sqlplus.htm">sqlplus</a>... here's my <a href="http://blog.choonkeat.com/files/poorman_crm.jsp" title="Poor Man's CRM for Oracle v0.1">Poor Man's CRM v0.1</a> - for you, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">free</a>.</p>

<p> Fill in the JDNI datasource, database owner, table, column and value.. see the &quot;e.g.&quot; And click &quot;Display&quot;, the script will </p>

<ol><li>Find the record you're refering to from the originating table</li>

<li>List all constraints pointing in and pointing out of that table, in a html table</li>

<li>Display all corresponding foreign-key values, in a html table</li></ol>

<p>This is currently good enough for me. Rightfully, I should recurse down the foreign-keys and do more clean ups.. but this will save my life for now. Hope it does for you.</p>
