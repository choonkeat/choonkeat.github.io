<p>Tried out <a href="http://www.picasa.com/google/?promo=hpp2">Picasa</a> and think its really kewl.. but Love says I'm biased because its from Google.. Am I? So I asked my ex-colleague, the reputed designer.. YP.<br /> <br /><blockquote> +YP+Lavito~: king le.. this software...<br /> +YP+Lavito~: apple's iphoto lose..<br /> +YP+Lavito~: for print one ...iphoto one more &quot;designer&quot;<br />+YP+Lavito~: foook...export album to webpage.<br />+YP+Lavito~: adobe album can eat grass liao..<br /></blockquote><br /> Ha! So.. go grab one now.<br /><br />PS: From the looks of the smooth UI.. I'm reallly looking fwd to Puffin now.. <br /><br /></p>
