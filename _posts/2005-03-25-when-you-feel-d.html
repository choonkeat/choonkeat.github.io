<p>Update: Ew. I didn't expect it to sound like I'm an irresponsible, pat-backside and go home kinda person. The whole if-nobody-dies philosophy is only adopted as the lastest resort of self-preservation. To keep sane.</p><p>Things has been going ill for Love <a href="http://nana.yanime.org/post/2/189">recently</a>. :-( Being in fire-fighting companies for the bigger part of my working life.. I'm <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">still</span> not sure if I have a good way to &quot;deal with it&quot;. (Btw, just to clarify, I'm not fire-fighting these days)<br /><br />I've been totally swamped before, worked 72-hours straight (powered by expresso double shots) and at many times questioned and doubted myself. No, this isn't (and I hope it won't be taken as) a I've-had-worse trophy talk. I remember asking myself, &quot;<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Or is the problem.. really just me?</span>&quot; &quot;<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">I'm perhaps not as capable as I'd thought</span>&quot; &quot;<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">perhaps I'm simply.. inefficient</span>&quot;. Boy, those were dark days.<br /><br />When you question yourself like that, you'll really lose your ability to accomplish things - a self-fulfilling prophecy..  and thus bleak days will only turn bleaker.<br /><br />Its only when I totally give up, detach myself - &quot;hey, I don't <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">own</span> this stinkin' place&quot; &quot;if things goes wrong,.. at least nobody dies&quot; - then does light appear. Mood lightens.. but sadly, it often means leaving the company. So, if you're a boss and you see that a previously <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">chao-bin</span> employee starting to be smiling more - he's leaving, and trust me a pay rise won't help.<br /><br />So I guess my only advise is, if nobody will die.. just let the things go wrong. Its perhaps <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">the</span> most effective way of explaining something to others, both to people above and below. And you'll sometimes be surprised at how you've <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">over-estimated</span> the actual impact of things going wrong without your intervention.<br /><br />So, keep yer chin up. You've still got me.<br /><br /></p><br />
