<p> <p><a href="http://demo.com/demonstrators/demo2006/63003.html">Wow</a>. Krugle looks like something that'll be super useful to me, considering I've been swimming in the sea of <em>Eclipse plugin development</em> today... very unproductive. Nice demo... enlightened me of what the vertical search market is about.</p> <p>Wonder if it can do searches like, </p> <p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><strong>get:</strong>org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell <strong><br />using:</strong>org.eclipse.ui.IActionDelegate<br /> </blockquote>  <p>&nbsp;<br />I tell ya, if something can help me <strong>chain up</strong> the list of &quot;potential methods&quot; from 1 class (that I have) to another class (that I'm trying to get at)... that'll really flatten out the learning curve of any new platform/library/watever...<br /> </p></p>
