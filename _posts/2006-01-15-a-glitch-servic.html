<p>Users of RssFwd service would've noticed a drop in emails received over the weekend, and yes, something was wrong. Mainly the new bounced-mail handler was over-zealous causing quite a lot of unnecessary subscription suspension.</p><p>I am very sorry for the glitch. <br /> </p><p>But as the Playstation executive said in The Apprentice, &quot;<em>Don't be sorry, just make it right</em>&quot;.... so the &quot;good news&quot; is, I do have records of all the subscriptions that were incorrectly removed, and am already in progress of restoring them right now. At things should be back to normal in a couple of hour's time.</p><p>Thanks for bearing with me. </p><p>(Note to self, listen to your instincts.)</p>
