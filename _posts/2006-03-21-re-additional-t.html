<p>I'm <em>still</em> not going to respond to <a href="http://duckdown.blogspot.com/2006/03/additional-thoughts-on-why-ruby-isnt.html">the complete (longish) article</a>.<br /> <br /> First, some agreements,<br /> <blockquote>Ruby is going down a path of creating their own Virtual Machine. It seems to me, that they should simply put Ruby on the Java VM and not waste efforts in reinventing the wheel<br /> </blockquote> VM. Sure. Whatever good stuff that comes. What's for keeps is the Ruby <strong>language</strong>. <a href="http://smallthought.com/blog/">Avi Bryant</a> had even <a href="http://paranode.com/~topfunky/audio/2005/Avi-Bryant.mp3">contemplated</a> [mp3] that its highly possible having Smalltalk VM (more mature) running Ruby code. Heck, why not?<br /> <blockquote>Ruby needs to address multilingualization quickly<br /> </blockquote> i18n. Definitely. Don't be so sure it ain't coming or nearing. Anyways my 2 cents is, I haven't seen any i18n done right (read: development phase). Runtime support for i18n is mature, and that's the easy part.<br /> <br /> Now the negatives, <br /> <blockquote>Ruby seems to be missing something that is otherwise fundamental in other languages which is support for Regular Expressions<br /> </blockquote> Holy cow! Missing <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ruby%20regular%20expression">regular expressions in Ruby</a>? That's funny. Firstly, its a common complain that Ruby inherited lots of stuff (good and bad) from Perl, guess what's included? My other 2 cents says that Java happens to have the worst regex support. Of cos, I'm talking about syntax.<br /> <blockquote>I also couldn't find the equivalent of instance variables. Wouldn't that make reuse at an enterprise-level somewhat problematic?</blockquote><blockquote>Shouldn't the notion of methods being public, private and protected also be a part of every modern language?&nbsp;</blockquote> Missing instance variable? Notion of public, private and protected methods? Boy, this guy needs to sit down with Bruce Eckel (Nothing against Bruce, just thought its a funny <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=146091">de ja vu</a>) Or more accurately, sit down with Ryan Davis.<br /></p>
