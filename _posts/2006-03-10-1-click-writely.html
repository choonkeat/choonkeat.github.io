<p><a href="http://writely.blogspot.com/2006/03/google-yep-google.html">Great</a>. Now I feel more safe putting my docs in <a href="http://www.writely.com/">Writely</a>, knowing that they won't <em>be going away</em> anytime soon.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm hoping they don't get too stuck on the whole social / collaboration / web2.0 thingy... Just give me <strong>1 URL to create a new &quot;Untitled&quot; document</strong>. I can bookmark that URL and hence, with 1-click I can create a new 'Word' document.&nbsp;<br /> </p><p>Briefly tried to do it just now, but there's too much javascript hoops to jump as a 3rd party to implement the simple feature.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't know about you, but I <em>always</em> have my browser running. So this will be a big deal. And maybe one day, I really won't need to use notepad.exe for scribbling anymore... 1-click.<br /><br />(assuming I can sign on persistently, gmail style)<br /></p><p>So,... Yahoo's gonna buy <a href="http://www.jotlive.com/">JotLive</a>?&nbsp;</p><p>Update: Ahh... appears to come true. 2 months later today: <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/05/10/rumor-yahoo-closed-jotspot-acquisition/ ">Rumor: Yahoo Acquired Jotspot</a> [JotLive == JotSpot Live ==&nbsp; JotSpot's product ]</p>
