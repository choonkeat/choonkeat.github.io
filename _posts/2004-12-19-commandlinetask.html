<p>I'm not sure if this was already out there somewhere. But I sure didn't find it. Anyways, my very slow (0.3GHZ) machine was coughing all the way whilst I'm trying to write some Java program at home, compiling them with <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>. Frustrated with the start-up delays, I wrote this very simple task to allow invoking of ant targets at will - without the slow startup that Ant has, everytime its called - <a title="CommandLineTask: Keeps Ant in memory to execute future tasks efficiently" href="http://www.yanime.org/CommandLineTask.java">CommandLineTask.java</a><br />To use, just add a new task definition into an existing build.xml:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>&lt;taskdef name=&quot;<strong>command</strong>&quot; classname=&quot;<strong>org.yanime.ant.CommandLineTask</strong>&quot; /&gt; </p></blockquote><p>And add a new target, say &quot;cmd&quot;:<!--StartFragment --></p><div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&lt;target name=&quot;cmd&quot;&gt;<br />  &lt;<strong>command</strong> /&gt;<br />&lt;/target&gt;<br /></div><p>Easy. Now, run your build, invoking the &quot;cmd&quot; target and you'll get a prompt. Type in any targetname to continue / repeat your process. The command line will remain until you type !. With so much speed up (22secs compile now takes 3 seconds!) for so little work (96 lines), I really wonder why I'd never written this helper earlier. Sigh.<br /><br />The only caveat is, don't use it if any classes used by Ant is being changed and needs a refresh (e.g. whilst developing CommandLineTask which is part of the taskdef in the build.xml) - but that's pretty rare.<br /><br />Update: Ok, looks like a decent sized compile eats over 100MB of RAM and that remains used, no matter how many times you recompile. So a best-of-both-world solution will be to exit ANT after every input commandline, but restart ANT to the command task's prompt immediately so that the next compile / commandline can start immediately without waiting for ANT's slow startup - parsing build.xml. At least that seems to improve my edit-compile-test cycle using Ant.<br /></p><br />
