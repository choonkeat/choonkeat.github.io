<p> It was kinda surreal watching my TV booting up. To be correct, my TV was showing the xbox (grudgingly?) booting up.<br /> <br /> The original intent was to try <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54192&package_id=57509">Xebian</a> (debian good, apt-get better!).. however probably something was wrong with the CDR (was I supposed to use CDRW?) even though many people said I'm lucky to have a Samsung drive on my crystal set... anyhoo.. went around looking for a 'network installable' Xbox Linux instead.. and ended up with.. <br /> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=248333">Gentoox</a>. By following a <a href="http://www.xbox-scene.com/articles/gentoo-share-drive.php">HOWTO article</a>, I managed to boot'em up. <br /> <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /> Installation review/feedback</span>: I'd initially thought my FTP screwed me up when it gave delirious error messages of &quot;Too many retries&quot; after I'd ftp'd over 3GB of files into my living room.. to make the panic panicker, the Gentoo menu on Evox just didn't work as advertised - it hung when its supposed to boot linux in 'less than 30 seconds.. '. However, prior to booting into EvoX, my <a href="http://www.smartxx.com/">mod</a> came with a &quot;boot linux from HDA&quot; option.. and that worked. It was then on the console that I saw the network startup had failed (that's why the hang?). Luckily, I have a USB converter (soldered by my good friend, gnay) + USB keyboard.. managed to rectify the config and get it online. <br /><br />[update: you may wish to try making ur home network to be DHCP when booting up Gentoox for the first time, since its preconfigured as DHCP.. so u can ssh in an change later..]<br /> </div> <br /> I should give Gentoox a go for a while and learn the Gentoo distro.. however, trying to go back to the apt-get world is just so tempting.. [xbox is still fetching those gentoo thingies.. takes so long!]<br /> <br /> TODOs:<br />1. Convince Love that she's not an xbox widow (politically correct to place this #1... )<br /> 2. Rearrange my network topo instead of dragging a 15m network cable [hazard!] into my living room.<br /> 3. Change to a bigger harddisk (<a href="http://www.xbox-scene.com/articles/hdd-ftp.php">Sounds quite safe</a> to DIY) since I only have 1.6GB free for games now. :-(<br /><br /></p>
