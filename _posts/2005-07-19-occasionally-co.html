<p>When I was taking my part-time bachelor's degree at <a href="http://www.auston.edu.sg/home/index.php">Auston</a> &quot;we take your education seriously!&quot; (think this deserves another blog post... ) I've had the fortune of having a <span style="font-style: italic;">great</span> lecturer for our web applications classes. The assignment she set for us: A Shopping Cart application. No server. No database. Javascripts only. Just a &quot;Success!&quot; page for payment.<br/>
<br/>
My reaction was: <span style="font-style: italic;">lame</span>. Her response: <span style="font-style: italic;">the rest of the (non IT background) students doesn't have time to study the full fledged web applications stack</span>. I still think she was lazy and had undercut her students.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-forward a couple of years to present day,... something dropped in from the O'Reilly Radar today: <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/07/trimpath_wow.html">TrimPath</a>. Here's a snippet from their 'vision' statement:<br/>
<blockquote>In a nutshell: mindlessly copy and port Rails, because it's a great web MVC framework. The result should be a web MVC framework that runs in either the client AND the server. While we're at it, explore and push the edges of occasionally connected web applications.</blockquote><br />
<br/>
Rails? Occasionally connected web applications? These people were so inspired by <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Rails Way</span>, they'd created a complete development framework to do standalone (browser-based) applications - that can work during absence of connectivity!<br/>
<br/>
What does that mean? Just try out this simple application: <a href="http://trimpath.com/demos/nextaction_static1/nextaction.htm">Next Action</a>. Its a productivity tool (todo list, blah blah, even comes with <a href="http://trimpath.com/demos/nextaction_static1/nextaction.htm">beautiful statistics page</a>) only thing interesting is - <b>you can save it to your computer, and use the browser application without being connected to a network (<a href="http://trimpath.com/project/wiki/NextAction">read how</a>)</b>. Developers, checkout the &quot;show me the code&quot; link in the application. Sweet.<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br/>
</span> Now if that lecturer had defined the project to be &quot;A todolist application. No server. No database&quot;... *shudder* nah, she can't possibly have grokked it this way.<br/></p>
