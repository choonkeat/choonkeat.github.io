<p>Mihai Parparita has done it again. Not only did he author my favourite (and prettiest) Greasemonkey script: <a href="http://persistent.info/archives/2005/12/23/greasemonkey">Gmail Macros</a>, he has now gone ahead and <a href="http://persistent.info/archives/2006/10/13/google-reader-redux">integrated Google Reader with Gmail</a>, using only <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a>.<br /></p><p>Btw, talk about &quot;<em>throw it against the wall and see what sticks</em>&quot;... Greasemonkey is probably one of the best enabler of such technique!<br /></p><p>I've imported all my <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/">RssFwd</a> subscriptions over to Google Reader to try out Mihai's Gmail Reader. So far so good. A few kinks here and there (e.g. unread Feeds doesn't bold like other labels, Gmail Macros can't go to Feeds with 'G, F' keystroke) but no show-stopper, and definitely nothing an official integration wouldn't fix - if there is one.<br /></p><p>There are differences between using RssFwd + Gmail and Google Reader + Gmail. In the former, content is &quot;in your hands&quot;. Emails are plain old emails. Take them anywhere, filter them, fwd them, do anything to them. We've had emails for donkey years now, there must be at least a hundred tricks you can do with emails - and none of them requires any new features from anybody. </p><p>On the other hand, Google Reader (like most RSS readers) will need to work towards making such tools/features available. The lack of features that we take for granted in the good'ol email makes the content in such readers feel more... transient in comparison.</p><p>I guess its just a matter of what suits you. For me, I'm giving myself sometime to see if this Gmail Reader usage pattern groove with me :-)</p><p>PS: What/How long does it take for Google to officially integrate <a href="http://persistent.info/archives/2005/03/01/gmail-searches">Persistent Search</a> &amp; Gmail Macros? Just do it already! *sigh*<br /></p>
