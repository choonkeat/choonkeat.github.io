<p> <p>Perhaps the <em>whole-world-but-me</em> already knows this... but I'd really never known I could refresh (Ctrl-R) directly at Firefox's View Source window! <br /> </p> <blockquote> <p>Write some code &gt; View with browser &gt; View source and see generated HTML<br /> Make code changes &gt; Refresh view-source window and see updated HTML<br /> </p> </blockquote> <p>Now that's quite a dandy <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230693#c14">feature</a>! Only found out just now when I'd accidentally refreshed the &quot;wrong window&quot; (so if you'd already known it, its only because you're clumsier than me. Tsk!)</p></p>
