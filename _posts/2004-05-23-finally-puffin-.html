<p>Good to hear that my <a href="http://www.google.com/">bestest friend</a> is going to launch a free, desktop searching tool code-named Puffin. In fact, I was just lamenting to my friend that searching the entire web is faster than looking for stuffs in on my harddisk.. which is least to say, a very pathetic and ironic state of affairs. In fact, <a href="http://www.blackball.us/b/nav//products/products/blackmagic">BlackMagic</a> recently caught my eye and seems impressive..  looks like a potential filler before Longhorn.. but now, we're gonna have Puffin too :-)</p><p>What BlackMagic has, in addition, is version control.. Kewl. Version control all your files in a particular drive.. easily search them too.. the non-IT saavy folks could at last use &quot;CVS&quot; with full integration to their desktop, plus ability to search - fast! -.. these to me, is the holy grail of desktop computing indeed. For what's the computer desktop for, if it doesn't increase your productivity???</p><p>Google has reinvented the email by using (their) search technology and challenging current norms (disk space, mail folders, delete mails). E-mailing has indeed changed since I used Gmail.. there's only 3 things to do after reading a mail, archive it, mark as spam, reply to it. No more folders.. put where.. delete la.. i don't need it.. do i need it?.. Archive! Simple change of mindset, a revolution not to be under-estimated. Changing the little things can sometimes start an epidemic.. (i'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316346624/102-1354649-2598548?v=glance">Tipping Point</a>)</p><p>Anyways.. I hope they'll reinvent something this time too. Surprise me, pleasantly.</p>
