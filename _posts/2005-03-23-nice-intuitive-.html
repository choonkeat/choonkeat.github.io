<p>Found this drop-down box in <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/">NowPublic</a>'s sign-up page.</p><p><img src="http://photos6.flickr.com/7182122_7b1f2548fc_m.jpg" align="baseline" /></p><p>Instead of the usual, more technical, &quot;<em>country</em>:+<em>0X00</em>hrs&quot; dropdown box, this one basically state the &quot;current time&quot; in each timezone, and you just have to choose the &quot;current time&quot; that matches yours! Sweet.</p><p>And also, your users from smaller countries won't feel left out.</p>
