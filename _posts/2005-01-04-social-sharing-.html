<p>First, I found <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> (check my puny attempt at <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/">posting pictures on the left</a>) and their <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags">refreshing way of using keywords</a> to build interest groups.. Now, (ok, i didn't know who started first!) I find <a href="http://www.43things.com/home/">43things</a>, with the same idea to push out TODO list! Its so kewl <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/view/choonkeat">I'm so doing it now</a>! Of cos, girls can probably mutate it to do shopping lists as well.. <br /><br />Sidenote: I think the app can be much improved by not solely relying on exact phrase matching. A good alternative without the need to create a implicit-dictionary-guessing engine for grouping of different phrases would be to <a href="/articles/2004/05/11/feedback-and-faq">reduce the chance of different phrases being created in the first place</a>. Less technical, more about user experience.<br /><br />Building interest groups organicly, via serendipity. No opt-in, no he-is-my-friend, no manual creation of groups - but in the words of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203009/">Moulin Rouge</a>, 'Come what may'. I'm building my TODO list, the crux isn't about having people share my TODO actions, but if there are people of common goals, all the better!<br /><br />I love this concept. Its so refreshing.. it begs for an even better, revolutionary use of it..<br /></p>
