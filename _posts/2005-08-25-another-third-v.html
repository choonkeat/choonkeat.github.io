<p>Poor <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991013034242/http://thirdvoice.com/">Third Voice, Inc</a> was way ahead of its time... (which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton">often not good</a>) now only remembered as &quot;<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/11/five_years_ago/">bright ideas that never caught on</a>&quot;. There's recently been a revival / rehash of the website-overlay-comments idea. First, with <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2005/03/28/newsmashing-aka-3rd-voice-redux">Newsmasher greasemonkey script</a>, now with <a href="http://hoodwink.d/">http://hoodwink.d/</a> [this link won't work for you? read on]<br/>
<br/>
I was pretty puzzled at Hoodwink'd actually - <span style="font-style: italic;">host not found, etc</span> -... only later did I realized I'd missed the all important first post: <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/-h/hoodwinkDDayOneForcingTheHostToAttendTheParty.html">Hoodwink'd, Day One: Forcing the Host to Attend the Party</a>. The cool factor is there.. including the website footer saying &quot;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/projectionist?m=102">this site was probably designed by 37 signals or the like</a>&quot;... one thing bugs me.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't have bandwidth (nor dream) to host a world of comments, Newsmasher (term was coined by <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2114791/">Paul Boutin</a>) merely piggyback'd on the hosting and community of <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> - and in order not to abuse delicious, Newsmasher would only display &quot;comments&quot; after clicking on the <span style="font-family: courier new;">&lt;c... /&gt;</span> overlay, and not load on every page you view.<br/>
<br/>
Hoodwink'd however, seems to be doing that - isn't that single-point-of-failure thing what made 3rd Voice a pain to use? Hopefully <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/">Why The Lucky Stiff</a> has a distributed system planned... <br/>
<br/>
PS: Yah, I haven't updated Newsmasher with delicious's new (months old) template<br/>
