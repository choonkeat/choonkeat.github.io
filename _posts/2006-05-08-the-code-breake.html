<p> <p>Just got to know there'll be a neat BBC documentary on Free/Open Source Software. Excluding the unearthly 3:30am and 5:30pm showtimes.. the more feasible showtime for Singapore will be: (for other timezones, pls check <a href="http://www.bbcworld.com/content/template_tvlistings.asp?pageid=668">at BBC directly</a>)</p> <blockquote><div class="vevent"> <a class="url" href="http://www.bbcworld.com/content/template_clickpage.asp?pageid=2783">  May 11, 2006 - 21:30  -  22:00  - <span class="summary"> The Code Breakers (r) 1 of 2 </span> - at <span class="location"> BBC Channel </span> </a> <div class="description"> For years Microsoft has dominated the world of computing, but its software is beyond the reach of many in the developing nations. This 2-part series investigates that the poorest countries are now changing tack and using Free/Open Source Software (FOSS). <br /> </div> </div>    <div class="vevent"> <a class="url" href="http://www.bbcworld.com/content/template_clickpage.asp?pageid=2783">  May 18, 2006 - 21:30  -  22:00  - <span class="summary"> The Code Breakers (r) 1 of 2 </span> - at <span class="location"> BBC Channel </span> </a> <div class="description"> For years Microsoft has dominated the world of computing, but its software is beyond the reach of many in the developing nations.

Editors should have hcal built in!)</p>        <p>So go home early on 11th, skip an episode of 至尊红颜 or something and go watch this. FOSS isn't just about anti-microsoft.... so hopefully they won't be just talking about Microsoft. </p></p>
