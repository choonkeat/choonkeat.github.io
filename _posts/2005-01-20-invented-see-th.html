<p>Well, the next time you walking-walking, feel some numbness and your handphone stop working.. somebody has probably saw you nude. Incredibulously, the crazy guy who invented the <a href="http://www.nfb.ca/grizzly/troy.html">impervious-to-Grizzly-bear suit</a> (I'd actually saw him on <span style="font-style: italic;">Ripley's Believe or Not</span>) had invented the <a href="http://www.baytoday.ca/content/news/details.asp?c=6657">Angel Light</a>. Whee-u-wheet!<br /><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br />&quot;... just a dream, and I saw it, saw the whole casing and everything, and I saw what it could do.. I had the same dream about that three times and by the third time I had it in my head and I started to build it..&quot;<br /></div><br />Sigh, ppl who rarely (remembers their) dream (like me) don't get to invent X-ray eyes.. Damn!<br /><br /><br /></p>
