<p> Feedback and FAQ is nothing new to the Internet. But they're often always separate entities of a website. Was browsing around my gmail (beta) account and clicked on the &quot;Feedback&quot; link.. which i would guess power their main beta-testing-feedback process.<br /><br />* [Page 0] Click &quot;Feedback&quot;<br />* [Page 1] Select category of feedback and give a &quot;Subject&quot; for your feedback (doubles as a search criteria too)<br />* [Page 2] Display snippets of matching FAQ (and their answers) on top, with links to click &quot;read more.. &quot;<br />                Display more form fields to complete the feedback (reply-to email, question details, etc)<br /><br />I think this is a very self-sufficient sub-system which is truely useful to both the end-user and administrators. The FAQ presented on top discourages persons to asking questions asked before.. also helps the user to search through the FAQ while trying to suggest/ask/feedback something... <br /><br />Just feel a tad dismayed that such sub-system isn't already a norm in the industry already. Somebody should do an open source project like this.. Not sure if <a href="http://faqomatic.sourceforge.net/">FAQ-O-Matic</a> already does.. but i think not.<br /><br />So, WWW (that's you, reader), why would anyone want to do a FAQ without a Feedback, a Feedback without a FAQ.. why would anyone want to implement anything that doesn't have the above flow? Other than lack of resources to implement?<br /><br /><br /></p>
