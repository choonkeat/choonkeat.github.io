<p>About a month old article, but I realise quite a few of us haven't seen it yet: <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.09/pokerbots.html?tw=wn_tophead_7">Online Gambling: Buy a Bot to play for you</a> <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote> For $200, you can buy the full package: a one-year subscription to the team edition, which includes the autoplaying bot and <span style="font-weight: bold;">a card-sharing module that allows multiple players to communicate during a game</span>. Bornert won't say how many customers he has; he'll admit only that he makes a living selling WinHoldEm<br/>
[emphasis mine] </blockquote><br/>
Now ethics aside, I'd say that's a brilliant idea! Getting a computer to gamble for you only lets you play in a methodical, steady manner while you sleep at night and wake up a few bucks richer.. but Team mode just puts you one up against the dealer! As YP says, <span style="font-style: italic;">FOOK!</span><br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.fantasmal.com/blog/">Grok</a> said before he's quite inspired by <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/donate.html">Bram Cohen</a>'s success story... I'd say this one is quite inspiring as well :-D <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Quick! Now think of an evil but obvious-idea! Oh no! I can't come up with any! My head's full of gambling bot now.. and about why i didn't come up with Team mode - arghh...</span><br/>
<br/>
On other stuff, Adam Bosworth gives a good talk on how software should be <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">designed and developed</span> evolved: <a href="http://salesforce.breezecentral.com/intelligentreaction/">Intelligent Reaction</a>. Good stuff! <br/>
<br/>
Been busy with something of late, will lift the curtain soon :-) <br/></p>
