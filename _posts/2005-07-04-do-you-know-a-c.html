<p>Just the other night, I was with Love when she was clearing her gmail - *click* on the checkbox of the third (or so) email, scrolled hastily down (she's quite a speed reader), *shift-clicked* on the checkbox several rows down and the inbetween emails got their checkboxes selected as well.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Eh? Wait! What did you do?.. Did you just hold the shift key?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Ya..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In disbelief, I tried. It works. *gasp*. Shift-click. Like I've seen it the first time. I mean, I know it works on usual desktop stuff shift-click to select a range of stuff... but webpages / checkboxes isn't supposed to be capable of that.. I mean.. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Duh&quot;, Love rolled her eyes and continued to slaughter her inbox. Now, I'm dumb.<br/></p>
