<p>Yes yes, I'm late.. but better than never. If you're still making expensive overseas call, but you and the other party is a <a href="http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2005/01/your_ingterneck.html">totally internet capable aunt y lilly</a> then you should give your pocket a break and <a href="http://www.skype.com/">download Skype now</a>. If you, like me, had lousy experience with Internet Phone, MediaRing, blah blah toys long ago and am now just jaded about VOIP.. drop all that bad memories and just click install.<br /><br />And this is all for free. For $$ then you can even call your non-internet enabled aunty lilly.<br /><br /><br /></p>
