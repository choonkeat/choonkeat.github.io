<p>Finally got around to fix the Rssfwd bookmarklet (wasn't working on Internet Explorer). Now it does, and also tested on Firefox and Opera 8.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I've added a tiny rssfwd icon/link thing to make <a href="http://blog.uwinnipeg.ca/schwagbag/archives/2005/05/post_1.html">site owner's</a> <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/archives/2005/05/17/cool_shifted_scsu_services.html">lives easier</a>.. no more hoops to jump to make your site subscribe-able. Just include a little picture like this:<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;"><br />
<br/><a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/powered_by"><img border="0" src="http://rails.yanime.org/subscribe_via_rssfwd.png" alt="Click to subscribe for email updates"/></a></div><br />
<br/>
Also.. fixed a big stupid bug. I didn't know feed detection failed on XHTML compliant websites. Duh. Things should just work now. Lemme know if anything thing doesn't.<br/>
<br/>
Also.. I just found some enterprising folks <a href="http://starting-a-businessx.blogspot.com/2005/04/bringing-back-nfl-could-be-bargain-for.html">using Rssfwd to push content to their site</a>. Heh. I'm still undecided whether that's a good thing or bad thing. I guess good.<br/>
<br/>
PS: Not done with my pick-a-VPS-hosting-plan yet. This is taking much longer than I thought.<br/></p>
