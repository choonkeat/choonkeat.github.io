<p>Would've been nice if <a href="http://www.sis.smu.edu.sg/Seminar/web2seminar.htm">Harry</a> could meet <a href="http://tomorrow.sg/archives/2005/06/14/bloggerssg_2005_-_the_agenda.html">Sally</a>. But it doesn't seem (from the agenda) that things will turn out so.<br/>
<br/>
Now such a booboo wouldn't have happened, had the <span style="font-style: italic;">gahmen</span> really been part of <a href="http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2005/06/sgblogconspirac.html">The Tomorrow.sg Conspiracy</a>, aye?<br/>
<br/>
