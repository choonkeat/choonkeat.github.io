<p>After 24hrs.. Railsday ended yesterday 1pm local time. I stank.</p>
<p>Glancing at the app I wrote, I said &quot;<em>Damn! 24 hours and only this? I should've finished it in a couple of hours!</em>&quot; But that's hindsight. The most demoralising moment during the competition was when I followed a Railsday update and looked at <a href="http://www.anarchogeek.com/images/nutrient_screenshot.png">some ppl's&nbsp;screenshot</a>. Regrets? Sure, I should've been more prepared. My stylesheets and design looked like it was picked up from the trash, crumpled, rethrown and pasted on the web. I did realise early on that &quot;<em>look and feel is important!</em>&quot; and decided to delegate the last 3 hours into just that.. no matter what ok? last 3 hours, spruce it up! Yeaahh rite. Also, I should've charted out detailed milestones early on, and just execute during&nbsp;Railsday&nbsp;- and don't deviate from the plan! Shuffling my feet costed me a good few hours.</p>
<p>I don't think I'm getting that PSP, iPod&nbsp;or Mac Mini. But! That wasn't my stated reason of my participation yah? (save face) It was learning, and learning I did. Because of the nature of my app (for others to write an app), I don't think I can safely put up it up for trying anytime soon. But, if you're interested to see what others has <em>beautifully</em> done, try visiting: <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2005/06/05/playing-with-rails-day-projects#comments">list of some of them</a>, <a href="http://friendr.com/user/login">Friendr</a>, <a href="http://spacetag.allconsuming.net/">Space Tag</a>, <a href="http://66.92.15.36/">Nutrient</a>, &nbsp;<a href="http://tackboard.trivialbydesign.com/">Tackboard</a>, <a href="http://overstimulate.com/articles/2005/06/05/rails-lesson-learned">some google map thing</a>, and the adventurous people can check out the projects directly from the <a href="http://railsday.com/svn/">SVN repository described</a>.</p>
