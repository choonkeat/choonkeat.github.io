<p>Very interesting. Its a &quot;Strategy-cast&quot; by <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=Adam+Curry">Adam &quot;Father of Podcast&quot; Curry</a> and Ron Bloom. <br /><br />Listen to <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dailysourcecode/DSC/Podshow20.mp3">this mp3</a> [mp3 download, hopefully those-whom-we-don't-speak-of don't think u're pirating anything..] <br /><br />Sorry if the mp3 is very lengthy.. but I think its worthy. Split it into smaller mp3s if you want (<a href="http://mp3splt.sourceforge.net/">this is what i use</a>, but a very unfriendly user interface).. its a very kewl sneak peek at the creation of an industry... Hey, how many times can one witness that in a lifetime? Enjoy. <br /><br />Note: the first few minutes are them talking of their history and background, the actual podcast topic starts around the 17th minute.<br /><br /></p>
