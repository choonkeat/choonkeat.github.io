<p>Yet another computer show at Suntec. I love it. Haven't went to such shows since... the AGP slot was kewl.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, nice to go there, see the booths tout great bargains, collect pamphlets... then going to Sim Lim to do the actual buying. LOL. I love my new desktop at home. $390 for a decent upgrade from my 1998 0.3GHZ to 2GHZ+512RAM (spending too much already, another 512 next month ok?). Now for some real <a href="http://www.actionscript.com/index.php/fw/1/towards-open-source-flash-development/">action</a>! :-D<br/>
<br/>
Ahh.. the Internet feels much better now. <br/></p>
