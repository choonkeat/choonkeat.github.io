<p>Today, Yanime officially founded its real hosting, including its very own domain name. Well, its a good start... Spry says I'm allowed to run almost any, even IRC, servers on this baby.. so my TODO list will broadly be:</p><p>1. Setup running chat server.<br />2. Develop bots and sample implementation to deploy on Yanime's own website.<br />3. Get CVS ready (or should just use <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>?)<br /></p>
