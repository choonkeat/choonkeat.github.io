<p>Managed to catch &quot;<a href="http://www.esplanade.com/SOPApp/espsop/portal_proxy?GXHC_gx_session_id_=e542a12114f9c83b&GXHC_IMP_COOKIE=e542a12114f9c83b&uri=tgT_xhMJoh-8eZ!0WH6clUQnDWOFt2HQtm@5_AaXmdLzvdh4NNTRPASA_2h,cGAgsJFM">The Revenge of the Dim Sum Dollies</a>&quot; last weekend... I must say, the white cabbage (ask Glen Ong!) is really funny.. especially liked the mat-rock-mix song, Parking Pontianah (depicting the woes of the URA parking attendant, aka Aunty Lilly).. thoroughly hillarious! At some point in the show, I almost couldn't catch my own breath.. darn good one Selina!<br /><br /><div style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;You call me the Parking Pontianah.. you curse me loud-ly.. you curse me loud-ly.. uh uh!<br /> You call me the Parking Pontianah.. I do my job proud-ly, I do my job proud-ly, uh uh!&quot;<br /></div> <br /> However, I must say I'm much dismayed with the CD purchased. The funniest part of the whole show were the stand-up jokes, between acts, etc.. unfortunately the CD only featured studio recorded songs.. boo hoo. I would've better desired a live recording that includes everything - including laughs from the crowd.. oh well!<br /> <br />Dollies dollies.. saw another VCD too.. took away only 1 quote with me.. <br /><br /><div style="margin-left: 40px;"> &quot;Bye.. And remember, don't step on the dolls if you see them.&quot;<br /> - a little Afghan girl (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283431/">Kandahar</a>, 2001) after her lesson learnt in anti-personnel mines. </div><br /></p>
