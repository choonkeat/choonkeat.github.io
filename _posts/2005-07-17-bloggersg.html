<blockquote>&quot;So, its gonna be this until the party at night ah?&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
I was asked whilst sitting on a high stool watching the <a href="http://tomorrow.sg/">Tomorrow.sg</a> ppl chat and IRC on TV. Apparently it isn't an event that suited everyone's taste. :-) <br/>
<br/>
Still it was interesting... seeing some faces, and recognizing them. Hope I wasn't caught drooling. Had to leave for family dinner so was out of the scene from 4pm onwards.. but hell, things I'd missed:<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
    <li>Free booze til 2130hrs! I only made it back around 2200hrs to catch my ice-melted glass and get photos.. <br/>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://tomorrow.sg/archives/2005/05/13/bellydance_discovery.html">Belly dancers</a>! Luckily <a href="http://stupid-genius.blogspot.com/">StupidGenius</a> made good use of his 12x zoom camera. and printed me a color photo using the Lexmark provided there. Solid! It really looks as if she was dancing for him only, even though he must've hidden behind the counter or something - sheesh! But he was dismayed a chio one kept positioning herself to be blocked by the other dancers.</li>
    <li>Boobies made appearances. (Yes.. It had to happen). Damn. No other attendees get to see this one too,since the event was long over then, so I didn't lose out too much. <a href="http://stupid-genius.blogspot.com/">StupidGenius</a> was caught too stunned to make use of his 12x this time. Looks like he still lack that blogger instinct.</li>
</ol>
And ya, <a href="http://xiaxue.blogspot.com/">Xiaxue</a> should really change her outdated pink photo. Just like mrbrown did. So late <a href="http://tomorrow.sg/">Tomorrow.sg</a> still hasn't got a Blogger.SG post? Must be all still sleeeeeping..<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I'm really impressed with the way MSN supported the event in the background... considering all the laptops making appearances there were iBooks. Heh.
