<p>Found <a href="http://www.macgeekery.com/development/gui_automation_with_applescript">this script</a> today that switches the Command and Option key on my Mac - especially useful when I plugin my PC keyboard to my MBP and need the LEFT-ALT key to act as &quot;Command&quot;, and WIN key as &quot;Option&quot;.</p>

<p>The script on the article won't work off the bat if you just copy-and-paste, try copying from this instead: <a href="http://pastie.caboo.se/89067">http://pastie.caboo.se/89067</a></p>
