<p>See la, Norton, never should you forget to pay your protection money.. now turf owner comes up with his <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.mspx">own roti prata</a> and even promises free weekly update liao la! So now an oily-hand's options are: &quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">If don't use pirated windows, then can don't use pirated Norton</span>&quot;, or &quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">Continue to use pirated windows, and pay licensed Norton</span>&quot;?, or &quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">Continue to use pirated windows and Norton, and Dreamweaver and everything else in the meantime</span>&quot;. Me thinks #1 and #3 more likely.<br /><br />Anyways, along with more pleasant news.. at the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">current rate</a>, <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/view/choonkeat">#11 on my todo</a> may just be coming true soon.. <br /><br /><br /></p>
