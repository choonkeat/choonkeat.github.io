<p>I've tried to skirt this for very long now, mostly because I'd leaned heavily towards simplicity (this extra step just seem so troublesome...)</p><p>Anyways, many bad encounters today (it never rains, but pours) so patched RssFwd to require a &quot;<a href="http://www.spamcop.net/fom-serve/cache/104.html">email verification check</a>&quot; for <strong>all new subscribers</strong>. If your email address (or any permutation of it) is not in the database, you're a new subscriber and will have to respond to a verification email. For existing subscribers already in the database, I'd taken the liberty to set you guys as &quot;confirmed&quot; to avoid any service disruption.<br /></p><p>*sigh*</p><p>But hey, at least my service adheres to Singapore's <a href="http://james.seng.sg/archives/2005/09/12/proposed_spam_control_bill_for_singapore.html">proposed Spam Control Bill</a> now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
