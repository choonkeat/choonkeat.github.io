<p>Went to Holland V on Sunday to makan with Love. And of cos, the primary objective is to try out the really kewl Segways!<br/>
<br/>

Yeah. The authorities say its part of an effort to &quot;<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/149699/1/.html">to introduce new technologies</a>&quot;.. (<span style="font-style: italic;">new? won't other ppl laugh and say its <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000343027143/">a four-year-old product.</a></span>?) And btw, didn't know that place is &quot;one north&quot;.. i mean, north of where? Jurong Island? Anyways!.. the experience isn't at all <span style="font-style: italic;">thrilling</span> as I'd hoped - I thought it would be Calvin and Hobbes kind of thrilling.. but not.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, there wasn't enough going around, and 1 demonstrator was nonchalantly riding it up and down the Holland V slope, talking on his handphone, perhaps to his girlfriend of watever, leaving only 2 more fella entertaining more passer bys. Up and down.. up and down he went...<br/>
<br/>
Then when its my turn, the fella was holding on to the Segway! I mean, the guy made me feel like I was.. <br/>

<br/>
Sheesh. Its a Segway buddy! If I can't really feel the balancing mechanism for myself, what's the different from standing on a stool? Even <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> gave much more leeway for Love when she was learning to cycle. Should've guessed that I won't be able to ride <span style="font-style: italic;">up and down</span> anywhere based on the location they'd chosen to display the Segways. I thought they would've chosen some open area like those in front of nobody-goes-there-shops near the carpark...<br/>
<br/>
Grr!... and I did choose to have lunch at Holland V precisely to try <span style="font-style: italic;">Segway </span>ya know?<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, had to fillup a survey after that. I'd rather wish they'd made me sign a &quot;i shall not hold authorities any responsibilities&quot; form and let me scooted around Holland V.<br/></p>
