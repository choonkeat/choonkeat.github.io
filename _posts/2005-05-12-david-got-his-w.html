<p>Looks like DHH got <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000454.html">his wish</a>, or partly at least, since <a href="http://news.com.com/Google+puts+brakes+on+Accelerator/2100-1032_3-5702969.html?part=rss&tag=5702969&subj=news">Google pulled the plug on their Web Accelerator</a>. With the impressively consistent bad PR from Google these days, *sigh*...<br /></p>
