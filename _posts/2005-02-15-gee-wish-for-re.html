<p>I'm using <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/">RssFwd</a> to subscribe to all my many news/blog/kewl feeds, and <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd_email.PNG">receiving them in my Gmail</a> - where I further tag and filter for easy reading and all that stuff.<br /><br />But as my subscription grows, I often get <span style="font-style: italic;">duplicate</span> news. Duplicate doesn't mean a copy of but rather: reports by different people on the same kewl thing that just happened, e.g. <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&ie=UTF-8&q=google+maps&btnG=Search+News">Check Out Google Maps!</a>, <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=nokia+microsoft&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&sa=N&tab=nn&oi=newsr">Microsoft and Nokia Marries</a> ... and the list goes on. Yes I can &quot;live with it&quot; and skip the message and blah blah blah.. but I do wonder if Gmail can cluster that for me too. I understand this kind of clustering is different from Gmail's own email conversations (aka threads), but they already have the technology: Google News.<br /><br />Maybe say, Gmail gives me a predefined handler for tag &quot;news&quot; (like how &quot;unread&quot; is a reserved tag that shows all ur unread emails, try search <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">label:unread</span>). And everything in there will be threaded via Google News style, instead of the usual Gmail conversations. And even better, I can tick something, and auto-create a thread-specific filter to &quot;mark as unread, skip inbox&quot;, call it the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">[ ] Same news different day</span> checkbox. Yippie!<br /><br />Ahh.. things are just so easy when you ain't doing them yourself.<br /><br /></p>
