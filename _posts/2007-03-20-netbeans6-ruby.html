<p> <p>I am so close to switching from Eclipse to Netbeans6 now - the JRuby powered IDE environment is really terrific. Just one missing thing: <strong>(Ctrl-Shift-R) Open Resource</strong></p> <p>What it does in Eclipse (IntelliJ also spots this feature) is basically to find and open any file, anywhere in the your workspace without navigating the folder tree - simply type, and a real-time search of the file names will be done. The sorted order respects proximity of projects and etc. &quot;*&quot; matching will work as expected.<br /></p>  <p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/choonkeat/427604995/"><img width="335" height="500" border="0" alt="Eclipse: &quot;Open Resource&quot; Dialog" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/171/427604995_7724abf46a.jpg" /></a></p> Can't live without <em>that</em>.<br /></p>
