title: "A New Plan for Spam: Turing"

<p>Background: Spammers don&#8217;t really mind when you delete their spam mails or &#8220;mark as spam&#8221;. Same reason <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/167713/WhyFromNigeria.pdf">they want to be obviously spam</a>: they only want to spend time communicating with the gullible. If they have to spend time communicating with people who wouldn&#8217;t end up being tricked (aka false positive), it would greatly increase their cost of business.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">Thomas Bayes</a> has served us well for a few years, now is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/">a great time</a> to employ Alan Turing&#8217;s help.</p>

<p>I propose to have an &#8220;F1&#8221; competition of sorts, for companies (or talented individuals) working on AI and NLP. Here&#8217;s the competition challenge:</p>

<p><strong>Hold a conversation with a spammer for as long as possible #TuringTest</strong></p>

<p>The entity that accumulates the longest durations over a period of time, e.g. 1 year, is champion for the year.</p>

<p>To do this, ironically, we need spam. We&#8217;ll need mail clients (e.g. Mail.app, Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook) to rewire &#8220;mark as spam&#8221; to deliver, round robin, spams mails to everyone participating in the <code>#F1forAI</code> competition.</p>

<p>From there, the end points will communicate with the spammer onbehalf of the end user, likely using the same SMTP server to hide scent.</p>

<p>And, that&#8217;s about it really.</p>

<p>Oh, yes we need a global ranking table, like the one Dropbox created for their <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/spacerace">Great Space Race</a></p>
