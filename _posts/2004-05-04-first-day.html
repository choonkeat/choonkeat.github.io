<p>Pretty kewl today... didn't know what to expect today actually.. feels like the new kid in class.. not knowing what the corporate culture might be.. even had a funny dream of my first day (yes, i dreamt)<br /><br />However, the butterflies would be settled down in a smoother transition since we'll (ya, there's 5 new staff) be doing a 3 day training on the company's core product.. SOP. Pretty neat stuff</p><p>--- Ok, the above was written nearing the end of the 1st day's training ---</p><p>Wonder what my friends had been psych-ing the supervisors behind my back? The people i'll be working with seem to have some preconceived idea of how i'm supposed to fare.. Oh no! Expectations! And in a seemingly &quot;bad scenario&quot; project.. hope i can get things together soon enough.. God guide me!</p><br />
