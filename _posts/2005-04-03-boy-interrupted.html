<p>I'll be out of action for the next 24 days. I don't foresee any disruptions to the rssfwd service.. (I've cleared much diskspace).. but if there is, my very sincere apologies :-( I'll try to check mails whenever I can.</p><p>Anyways, give <a href="http://www.daishar.com/blog/archives/2005/03/greasemonkey_fo.html">GreaseMonkey on IE</a> [<a href="http://www.daishar.com/blog/archives/2005/03/greasemonkie_up_1.html">updated download</a>] a try.. (super alpha, doesn't even install on mine well.. ). I hope <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">GreaseMonkey</a> scripts will become the defacto 'cross browser plugin' platform, and gets built into browsers directly. Oh well.. time to leave my brains at home... </p><p>And I predict it'll be a <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">DAMN beautiful</span> day on 29th April...</p><br />
