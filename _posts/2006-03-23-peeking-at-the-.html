<p>Web Developer's Quiz: Your website needs to somehow <strong><em>know</em></strong> what are the other websites a user had already visited. How do you do it? How do you get the information from a browser history?<br /></p><p><a href="http://www.feedblog.org/">Kevin Burton</a> pulled it off with a neat trick. When the new features of his Tailrank were <a href="http://www.feedblog.org/2006/03/tailrank_launch.html">released</a>. I must've been sleeping or busy, anyways, didn't check out the improvements in Tailrank till now.</p><p>Under &quot;<a href="http://tailrank.com/import">import</a>&quot;, a user usually uploads his OPML file (which I'd <a href="../../articles/2006/02/21/tailrank-personalised-google-news-for-blogs">previously talked about</a>), input some URLs, etc. In his attempt to make Tailrank's import applicable to more layman users, Kevin has a new &quot;Auto Configure&quot; button. Click on it, and a list of popular sites (that you&nbsp; have visited) are found and is ready for import. Damn, how did it know! </p><p>I did some view-source hunting and found <a href="http://www.faqts.com/knowledge_base/view.phtml/aid/7157">document.defaultView.getComputedStyle</a> and <a href="http://www.thescripts.com/forum/thread89231.html">element.currentStyle</a>. Explain: Given that your browser will style visited links differently from link not yet visited, Kevin merely printed a bunch of hidden links and used a javascript to pick out those you have visited! Woot! I can sure find some use for that... hmm.. can't think of any now, but I'm sure there're uses!<br /></p><p>That said, I would've preferred if Tailrank actually gave me the option to uncheck some of them from my list (especially since removal of feeds isn't implemented yet)<br /></p>
