<p>This <a href="http://railsexpress.de/blog/articles/2006/08/15/rails-template-optimizer-beta-test">template_optimizer</a> plugin looks great. If it can compile for <a href="../../articles/tag/krjs">KRJS</a> too, that'll remove its only drawback of slower rendering speed due to method inspection. Any one with a free hand to give it a try?<br /></p>
