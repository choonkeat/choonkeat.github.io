<p>The western father of Ruby, Dave Thomas, gave the opening keynote highlighting 3 unsolved problems in Rails (paying tribute to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_problems">the 23 problems of mathematics</a>)&nbsp;</p> <ol>   <li>Database Integration: <br />   </li>   <ol>     </ol>   <ul>     <li>ActiveRecord models to extract has_many, belongs_to, etc relationships directly from foreign keys,</li>     <li>Migrations to absorb validation declarations: validates_presence_of, validates_numericality_of...<br />     </li>   </ul>   <ol>            </ol>    <li>Real-world CRUD (Scaffold)</li>   <ol>     </ol>   <ul>     <li>Handles models' relationships<br />     </li>     <li>In-browser validation</li>     <li>Skinning<br />     </li>     <li>AJAX<br />     </li>   </ul>   <ol>                      </ol>    <li>Deployment: Splitting Capistrano to 2</li>   <ol>     </ol>   <ul>     <li>Server capistrano declares policies and support</li>     <li>Client capistrano declares what is needed (i.e.dependencies)</li></ul></ol><p>I'm sure I missed out some. So, there you go, a todo-list for Railers. Too bad RailsDay is over. A motivated 24-hour crunch is good for doing unsexy stuff like these.<br /> </p><p>And yea, I'll agree with Dave there, I mentioned this on e27 just the other day: <strong>Ruby corrupted me!</strong> I'm looking at Ruby code all day these days... and every other language source code is beginning to look so.. so ugly... </p><p>Session's startin. <a href="http://facebook.railsconf.org/users/43">See ya</a>.&nbsp;</p>
