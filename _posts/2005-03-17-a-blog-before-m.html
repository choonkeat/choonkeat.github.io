<p>Angsty piece.. apparently aggregated many episodes in 1 entry.. tsk tsk. Hey <a href="http://cheekybynature.blogspot.com/2005/03/encounter-with-african-player.html">bro</a>, I'd never realised there's so many expressways in Singapore.. <br /><div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px"><br />I have been assigned to work at Tuas recently. Sorry, not just Tuas. In fact, it is Tuas SOUTH. KNN, Tuas South is one f*cking ulu place. I have to drive thru six expressways (TPE, SLE, BKE, KJE, PIE, AYE) to get there, and it is taking me one f*cking hour to reach my work place. And I have to do this for 2 man-months, which is 40 working days!
