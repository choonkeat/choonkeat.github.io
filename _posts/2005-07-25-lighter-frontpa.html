<p>As <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2005/07/15/rssfwd-special-treatment-for-laggards#comments">requested by a few of you</a>, incl Love and myself :-P, I've made <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd">Rssfwd's main page</a> lighter with a 'popular | all' switch just above the tag cloud.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, things happened and couldn't go about implementing OPML import/export last weekend. Soon.. soon :-P<br/>
<br/>
I hope I have time to talk about and implement <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.asp?p=398884&amp;rl=1">clustering</a>. Here's <a href="http://rssdiary.marketingstudies.net/content/when_there_is_too_much_rss.php">why rssfwd will definitely need it</a>.</p>
