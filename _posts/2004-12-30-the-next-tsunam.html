<p>I don't like doom and gloom talks too.. but <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/12/29/1910241&from=rss">this article</a> brought up old concerns. Now that the Indian Ocean Tsunami has caught the world's attention.. perhaps its time governments should wake up to the <a href="http://www.gwynnedyer.com/articles/Gwynne%20Dyer%20article_%20%20Gee-Gees%20(revised).txt">hapless cries</a> that scientists has been wailing for sometime now - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/mega_tsunami.shtml">Mega-Tsunami from the Canary Islands</a>. <br /><br /><div style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;..Scientists predict that it will generate a wave that will be almost inconceivably destructive, far bigger than anything ever witnessed in modern times. It will surge across the entire Atlantic in a matter of hours, engulfing the whole US east coast, sweeping away everything in its path up to 20km inland. Boston would be hit first, followed by New York, then all the way down the coast to Miami and the Caribbean..&quot;<br />- BBC<br /><br />&quot;..No national leader wants to evacuate the entire coast for an indefinite period of time, causing an economic and refugee crisis on the scale of a world war, for what might be a false alarm.  But nobody wants to ignore a warning, and perhaps be responsible for tens of millions of deaths.  From a political standpoint, it's better not to have the warning at all..&quot;<br />- journalist Gwynne Dyer<br /></div><br />Happy New Year all.<br /><br /></p>
