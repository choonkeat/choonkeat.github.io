<p>Some of you have asked for this since many moons ago. Finally plugged it <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/publishers">live</a>. Select and unselect at the <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/preview?url=http://blog.yanime.org/xml/rss/feed.xml">preview page</a>.. and watch the preview toggle between html and text.<br/>
<br/>
Its late. Shutting down..<br/>

Btw, do you know that if you subscribe to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">same feed</span> with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">same email</span>, you won't be double-subscribed? Your original subscription will merely be updated. A new subscription won't be created.<br/></p>
