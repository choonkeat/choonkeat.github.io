<p>Lemme see.. in order to be fast, well integrated UI...  <a href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?q=puffin+google&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search&meta=">Puffin</a> will hafta.. <br />1. Indexing<br /><blockquote>a) Background / Screen-saver indexing of your harddisk (boring.. )<br />b) 1-time indexing 'wizard' when installing (boring.. )<br />c) All of the above, plus newly created/updated files are monitored and indexed as per Anti-virus does.<br /></blockquote>2. Searching: Indexes will be several times larger than the content itself, so where are all these gonna be residing?<br /><blockquote>a) Google will host, so Puffin actually searches your indexes online (hosted by Google). So, your harddisk search will be as <i>slow</i> as your google search.. (*ringgggggggg* privacy alarms goes off) but that's still faster than searching for anything in your hddisk now!<br /></blockquote><br />Any bright ideas anyone?<br /><br /></p>
