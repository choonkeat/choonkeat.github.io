<p>Below is an email Q&amp;A I had recently: <blockquote><br />
<p><strong>I know u are a proponent of Ruby on Rails. What is the main thing about the Rail f/w that is so productive?</strong><br/>
</p><br />
</blockquote>First thing, before the wrong foot etc.. <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2005/06/14/wrong-fight">this entry</a> will clarify what i think Rails positioning is. So, the keywords i guess is: quick &amp; agile.<br/>
<blockquote><br />
<p><strong>a) Ruby the scripting language?</strong><br/>
</p><br />
</blockquote>maybe its a the joy of learning a new language... but ruby is quite fun to code in, albeit the lack of code-completion editors (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rubyeclipse">maybe not for long</a>). but perhaps its b'cos i'd programmed without code-completion for the larger part so can still settle with that lack.<br/>
<br/>
update: I'd forgotten to mention that I missed the power and ease of arrays in a scripting language (compared to Java or C), and also the code block syntax in Ruby is insanely cool even <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/07/12/ruby-colored-blocks-in-python/">when compared to</a> a beautiful language like Python.<br/>
<blockquote><br />
<p><strong>b) The framework (What part of it)</strong><br/>
</p><br />
</blockquote>I like that it comes with a pretty good ORM. Also, I only need to know very few conventions to get started. Yes these can be generalized into &quot;small learning curve&quot;.<br/>
<blockquote><br />
<p><strong>Why no Java/.Net/C++/VB etc has copied it point for point then ?</strong><br/>
</p><br />
</blockquote>Regarding clones, there is: <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000276.html">.Net</a>, <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=29716">Java</a>, <a href="http://subway.python-hosting.com/">Python</a>, even <a href="http://ripcord.co.nz/biscuit/forum/?controller=forum&amp;action=index">PHP</a>. But who's interested? - and that's actually quite important question: Can framework-X garner the same level of PR/momentum/growth? Clones are just pet projects out to prove X-can-also-do-Y. The original is currently used for bread-and-butter projects by DHH and <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/scoble_wonders_if_37signals_is_influencing_microsoft.php">co</a>. So they're very actively on it, using it, etc. The original was <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000416.html">extracted from a project, not written to a designed spec</a>. Why not somebody invest to use those clones as bread-and-butter? Well, wouldn't that somebody rather use Rails instead? unless, of cos, they've an axe to grind against Rails.<br/>
<blockquote><br />
<p><strong>c) The domain chosen?</strong><br/>
</p><br />
</blockquote>hmm, don't really understand. its for building general web apps.<br/>
<blockquote><br />
<p><strong>d) The philosophy ?</strong><br/>
</p><br />
</blockquote>Probably. convention over configuration is probably the first breath of fresh air. i'd originally cited this as a &quot;no xml config file nightmare&quot; thing, but actually it runs deeper, especially parameters passed to-and-fro forms/post, database column naming, before_* after_* hooks (benefits from very primitive AOP), where the files are placed (easy to learn another app) etc.<br/>
<br/>
When doing Rails, I feel as if somebody has felt the same pain as I and here are his consolidated solution for each and every problem, and I gratefully receive a solution for our lessons learnt.<br/>
<br/>
Very little things - <span style="font-style: italic;">may be detrimental to cite this example and make it seem like child's play</span>.. but I found myself smiling when I learnt this - like e.g. having an 'employee_counter' column in the &quot;companies&quot; table.. just having it and Rails will do the rest: e.g. +1 whenever a new &quot;employees&quot; record is inserted. very little things. update: also, a verbose error 500 page with stacktrace, session data, http parameters by default - but when in production mode, outside world sees 'friendly error page'.. but localhost still gives you the verbose errors to help debugging, how thoughtful!<br/>
<br/>
And for the record, this is the blog entry that I stumbled upon Rails: <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5424?page=last&amp;x-maxdepth=0">Award for beautiful coding: David Heinemeier Hansson</a><br/>
<br/>
update: I'd also forgotten to mention that I'd always preferred saving <i>development time</i> than saving <i>runtime</i>.</p>
