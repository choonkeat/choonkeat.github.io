<p><a href="http://www.ucomics.com/calvinandhobbes/">Calvin's</a> wisdom wins the day. Downloaded the anticipated Microsoft's version of desktop search: <a href="http://beta.toolbar.msn.com/">MSN Toolbar Suite</a>. Yay. Has the option download a PDF plugin to search inside .PDF files. Yay. Has yet-another-popup-blocker. Yay. Now the usable space on my taskbar shrank by another 2 inches. Yay. Not so thrilling afterall.<br /><br />Sidenote: Yet-another-remember-form-fields feature.. why can't anyone just accept that Gator-spyware really has a good idea and just emulate them instead. Minus the bad intent. <br /><br />Anyways.. I'm probably more caught up with a kewl idea, implemented for Linux as <a href="http://www.nat.org/dashboard/">The Dashboard</a>. <br /><br /><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Excerpt: For example, if a friend IMs you and says &quot;I can't wait for our camping trip this weekend!&quot; the dashboard will show things like your recent emails about the camping trip, your camping bookmarks, and any files or notes you've got on your hard drive about camping.<br />[<a href="http://www.nat.org/dashboard/rewrite.png">screenshot</a>]<br /></div><br />CRM-ready desktop. Not a bad huh? This concept is so going to make it into the enterprise, by this name or <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1008_3-5110910.html">another</a>.<br /><br /></p>
