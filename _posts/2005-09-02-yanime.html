<p>Its funny how one thing lead to another.. I might just be re-igniting the development of my flash chat engine - which happens to be (surprise) the source of my domain name: yanime: <span style="font-weight: bold;">y</span>et <span style="font-weight: bold;">an</span>other <span style="font-weight: bold;">i</span>so<span style="font-weight: bold;">m</span>etric <span style="font-weight: bold;">e</span>ngine. I'd started it, and it went on hold, collecting dust while my then-new job took be into a roller coaster project. During that period, I found Rails.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, yanime is GPL open sourced.. just gotta figure out how to. I check-in the .FLA? Until then, you can see the current reference implementation: <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/yanime/sampleui.html">here</a>. Oh ya, its raw but its pluggable and XML based.<br/></p>
