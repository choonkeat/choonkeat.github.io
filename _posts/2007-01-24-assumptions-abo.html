<p>  <p>A nice little <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/internet/0,72542-0.html?tw=rss.index">article in Wired</a> yesterday mentions <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/">RssFwd</a></p>   <blockquote>The Feed Is in the Mail<br />  Even some the best RSS clients lack compelling archiving features -- older headlines drop out of sight after a day or two. Thankfully, sites like RMail and RSSfwd provide simple archiving by delivering feeds to your e-mail account.<br />  </blockquote>   <p>&quot;Archiving&quot;? Hmm. I wonder if the writer has <a href="http://www.kbcafe.com/juice/?guid=20050424102714">read this</a> before, regarding <a href="http://www.r-mail.org/">RMail</a> [emphasis mine]</p>   <blockquote>...emails are sent every hour, on the hour, <strong>at most one email per hour</strong>. </blockquote>   <p>Absolutely nothing wrong with that policy. A conscious decision to protect the subscriber's mailbox. However, it also means that if you've subscribed to <a href="http://slashdot.org/">high</a> <a href="http://digg.com/">traffic</a> feeds for archival purposes, you'd be in for a <em>little</em> surprise when you discover your archive isn't anywhere complete. (Note below: <strong>Highlighted are emails from Rmail</strong>, the rest is from RssFwd. Both are subscriptions to the same Slashdot feed.)</p>   <p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/choonkeat/367945639/"><img width="500" height="361" border="0" alt="RMail and RssFwd" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/138/367945639_6108aff171.jpg" /></a>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Something missing?&nbsp;</p><p>There are really many RSS-to-Email services out there. Some has accounts and passwords, some <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/publishers/emailsub">can only be used for certain feeds only</a>, some <a href="http://www.feedblitz.com/features.asp">sends 1 email daily unless you pay</a>, many has complex features, and there are some which <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/">simply sends an email for each update</a>. Each serve its own target audience. Do make sure you are the correct audience.<br /></p></p>
