<p> Its precisely because of <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=822&tag=nl.e539">RSS's Flexibility</a> and Atom's existence that I'd written <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/">RssFwd</a> in the most standards-ignorant approach. Had I went on to <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss">read</a> the RSS spec, stuck to standards, and fret over why <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A%2F%2Fradio.weblogs.com%2F0001011%2Frss.xml">some</a> <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.sun.com%2Froller%2Frss%2Fjonathan">people</a> didn't do it the best-practiced way... I would've long pulled my hair out. Instead, if-this-exist-else-use-that-or-that-or-that dirty approach has worked well for me mentally and technically.<br /><br />Btw, you can <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A//blog.yanime.org/xml/rss/feed.xml">subscribe</a> to my rants ;-)<br /></p>
