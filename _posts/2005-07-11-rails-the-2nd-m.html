<p>Rails has released an updated video (see previous video <a href="http://media.nextangle.com/rails/rails_setup.mov">here</a>),&nbsp; originally prepared for a conference presentation. So the audio you hear is actually from the presenter trying to <span style="font-weight: bold;">catch up</span> with what David is typing in his silent movie.<br/>
<br/>
All web developers should view it: <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/media/video/rails_take2_with_sound.mov">HERE</a> (15 minutes video). And maybe we should run a quiz for watching the video clip like: How many things can you spot him not being <span style="font-weight: bold;">required</span> to do? <br/>
<br style="font-style: italic;"/><br />
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;aiyah..I deen install quick time&quot;</span><br style="font-style: italic;"/><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;install. its fucking worth it.&quot;</span><br/>
</div><br />
<br/>
I hope nay sayers realise, its time to say goodbye to some &quot;commodity&quot; practices. Its been, what 10 over years? of web development.. isn't it time to <span style="font-style: italic;">move on</span>? Why are we still haggling over trivial design decisions like foreign key naming?<br/>
<br/>
Time to leave such stuff to the framework. And <span style="font-style: italic;">move on</span>.<br/></p>
