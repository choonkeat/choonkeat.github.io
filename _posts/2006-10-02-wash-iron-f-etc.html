<p>There was some serious discussion and division of household duties this afternoon over a nice meal at Soup Restaurant. The meeting ended with me taking on the Washing, whereas Love landed the Ironing duties. Though her gleam made me suspicious that I got the shorter end of the stick, my spider sense predicts otherwise. </p><p>Washing is mostly braindead labor and logistics, hence has room to be automated further. Whereas, Ironing is an intricate process of pressing something hot on delicate materials - this requires attention and spans the whole process.<br /><br />Also, history is on my side. The Ironing equipment might have improved from coals to electric/steam, but the process has hardly changed. On the other hand, Washing has come a long way from beating a stick beside the river, to scrubbing with washboards, to now - sitting beside the machine reading a book.<br /></p><p>A high-end <a href="http://store.irobot.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=2174932&amp;cp=2174940">roomba</a> is slated to be making its rounds in the house every day (its noisy, so only while we're out at work). No cooking will take place, hence plates washing &amp; other kitchen duties will be bare minimal.</p><p>In our pursuit to set up a least-maintenance-accomodation, I think we're just left with finding a solution for curtains: No dark panes, no monthly washing / dusting, no troublesome hooks nor heavy drapes. Hmm.<br /> </p><p>Its great that both of us are lazy. Goals align naturally where there's least resistance.<br /></p>
