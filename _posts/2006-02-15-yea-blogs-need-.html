<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> has taken to discuss <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/02/13/blogs-need-an-email-solution/">syndication of RSS content with e-mail</a>, in response to Fred Wilson's <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/09/email_vs_rss_co.html">RSS vs Email series</a>. And I'm very grateful for the good words on <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/">RssFwd.com</a> in the comments.<strong> Thanks folks!!</strong><br /> </p><p>Michael goes on to write his wishlist for an ideal feed to email service, one of it is &quot;<em>I am in control of the email list; no spamming by the service provider</em>&quot;. Hmm, I have a different take, but that's <a href="../../articles/2005/11/20/faq-as-a-publisher-will-i-have-access-to-the-email-addresses-of-my-subscribers-like-feedblitz-does">another story</a>. <br />  </p><p>As for templates,... actually, instead of paying for customisation, how about feeds returning &quot;templated and email-ready&quot; content when the user-agent is a known email-aggregator? Just a thought.</p><p>Update: Customized footers are <a href="../../../articles/2006/03/05/upgrade">now available</a>. Just let me know if you need customisations.&nbsp;</p>
