<p>Remember those dorky <font color="#339900"><strong>green</strong></font>/<font color="#ff0000"><strong>red</strong></font> 3D glasses you wear to see 3D films? Saw one in <a href="http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/otmovie.jsp?type=8&root=0&parent=0&cat=82">Omni-Theatre</a> donkey years ago.. Apparently there's been technology to bring such images to your eyes without the need to wear those glasses. Kewl. Check out <a href="http://www.sharp3d.com/technology/howsharp3dworks">Sharp 3D</a>.</p><p>Now Sharp is sellin <a href="http://www.sharpsystems.com/products/pc_notebooks/actius/al/3du/">Linux Laptops</a> with this autostero technology. Wonder if NTUC will pick that up.. </p><p />
