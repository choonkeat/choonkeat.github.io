<p>There are so many things to read on the web - tech news, links from
friends and blogs - and I’d open them, “hmm looks interesting, will
read them later” but never could find time to do so in day.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://grokked.tumblr.com/">grokked</a>: hi, do
you know any web service that can add arbitary web pages to an RSS
feed? like i have a whole bunch of pages open in my browser and i want
to just add them into google reader for review later<br />
<em>me: maybe can email urself the page or soemthing.. or maybe delicious them. that’s also an RSS<br />
</em>grokked: i was thinking more of the actual page appearing within google reader… this only give me urls<br />
<em>me: hmmm</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And hence an experimental feature was quietly launched: The “read
later” bookmarklet - Click on the bookmarklet and <a href="http://sharedcopy.com/">SharedCopy</a> will stash
the page somewhere for you to read later, in your favourite feed reader:</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://sharedcopy.com/">Try it out!</a> You can find your own “read later” feed at the bottom of your account “Settings” page :-)</p>
