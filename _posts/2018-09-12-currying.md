> Currying is this thing to make `add3` functions.

“Currying” isn’t a a foreign concept, but neither has it been a particularly useful concept for me. Everytime I read about currying, it is about that function that accepts 2 numbers and returns a sum of those 2 numbers

``` js
function add(x, y) { return x + y }

add(3,2) // => returns 5
```

and magic happens when

``` js
// but if you curry it
add3 = add(3)

// you can use `add3` anytime, anywhere you ever need to add `3` to things!!1!
add3(2) // => returns 5
```

anytime? anywhere? amazeballs.

Ok ok, if not `add3` as illustration, then what? Switching from not-ever-using-it<sup>[[1]](#footnote1)</sup> to using-it-multiple-times-recently<sup>[[2]](#footnote2)</sup>, I'd like to offer a more relevant and practical example

Let’s say we’re trying to process a list of content… e.g. tweets

``` js
function processTweet(tweet) {
    return `{tweet.User} says, “{tweet.Text}”`
}

arrayOfResult = map(processTweet, arrayOfTweets)
```

`map` will pass each tweet from `arrayOfTweets` into function `processTweet` and returns an array of the corresponding result.

``` js
map(processTweet, [ { User: 'Alice', Text: 'Hello' }, { User: 'Bob', Text: 'World' } ])
// returns [ 'Alice says, “Hello”', 'Bob says, “World”' } ]
```

So far so good.

Say we want to enhance it with more context and find ourselves needing other things to do the processing, e.g. `me` or even a `db` cache — i.e. we want to append a list of common friends

``` js
return `{tweet.User} says, “{tweet.Text}”` + sharedBy(db, me, tweet)
```

So.. how do we get `db` and `me` in there? Without currying, we’ll have to settle for inline lambdas with closures

``` js
let db = ...
let me = ...

arrayOfResult = map(function(tweet) {
    return `{tweet.User} says, “{tweet.Text}”` + sharedBy(db, me, tweet)
}, arrayOfTweets)
```

Oh dear. We've lost our standalone, reusable, test-friendly `processTweet` function. Now it implicitly need a `db` and `me` to work (but you won't know about it until it crashes)

``` js
map(processTweet, [ { User: 'Alice', Text: 'Hello' }, { User: 'Bob', Text: 'World' } ])
// boom shakalaka
```

How about we overcomplicate `processTweet` to be a function returning a function instead?

``` js
function processTweet(db, me) {
    return function(tweet) {
        return `{tweet.User} says, “{tweet.Text}”` + sharedBy(db, me, tweet)
    }
}
```

The function source is a bit convoluted, but using it can be quite nice

```
arrayOfResult = map(processTweet(db, me), arrayOfTweets)
```

With currying, there is no ceremony — `processTweet` remains a straightforward function that takes in the required arguments, does the processing, and returns the result.

``` js
function processTweet(db, me, tweet) {
    return `{tweet.User} says, “{tweet.Text}”` + sharedBy(db, me, tweet)
}
```

and we use it like it's a function returning a function, simply by omitting some arguments

``` js
arrayOfResult = map(processTweet(db, me), arrayOfTweets)
```

To me, that's pretty sweet.
