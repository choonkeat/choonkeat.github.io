Not Perl. Not Java. Not Linux. Not Quake. Not Burn-out III. Not Grand Turismo 3. I was joking with my friend that I should start to name drop sublimally like <span style="font-style: italic;">rails</span> in conversations <span style="font-style: italic;">rails </span>with people, where <span style="font-style: italic;">rails </span>I'd mention the word &quot;Rails&quot; here and <span style="font-style: italic;">rails</span> there and maybe it'll <span style="font-style: italic;">rails </span>get people to check out <span style="font-style: italic;">rails </span>what's the big deal about <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>?<br/></p>
