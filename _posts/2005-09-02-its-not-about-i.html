<p>New book to get my hands on: <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went To India (and all I got was this lousy book)</a>. <br/>
<br/>
It <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> be a controversial sounding title to the more sensitive. But I beg you see past that. I've just read the 6 PDF snippets (ex content page), and I'd give it thumbs up - loved them <span style="font-weight: bold;">all</span>!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>While managing an application development group, I once asked one of my employees, &ldquo;What do you want to do with your career? What do you want to be?&rdquo; I was terribly disppointed by his answer: &ldquo;I want to be a J2EE architect.&rdquo; I asked why not a &ldquo;Microsoft Word designer&rdquo; or a &ldquo;RealPlayer installer?&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
This guy wanted to build his career around a specific technology created by a specific company of which he was not an employee. What if the company goes out of business? What if it let its now-sexy technology become obsolete? Why would you want to trust a technology company with your career?<br/>
- Your Eggs in Someone Else's Basket [<a href="http://media.pragprog.com/titles/mjwti/eggs.pdf">pdf</a>] </blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Love would be <span style="font-style: italic;">smirking</span> now at my chosen snippet - it resonates my thoughts on people whom are &quot;Flash-programmer and nothing else&quot;... which I find to be rather common trait these days. <br/>
<br/>
ARGH. I've been on a buying spree (sorry honey) and I'll have to bite my lips on this one until it comes to the local Borders - instead of getting it online (or the PDF-only version, if they should start releasing? pls? no?)<br/>
<br/>
I've heard of a story, where a boss read &quot;Who Moved My Cheese&quot;, loved it and pass to his #2 man. That guy read it, inspired, passed to the #3 guy and left the company. The #3 guy read it, inspired, passed to a #4 guy and left the company as well! The boss quickly took the book away and stopped the circulation he'd started.<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid this book will have such power. Hence, even though I'm not a boss nor have I read the whole book yet, I'm hesitant on how to best recommend it. <br/>
<br/>
For a start, maybe you can read <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">the PDFs</a> I haven't recommended. (yes mich, that includes you) <br/>
