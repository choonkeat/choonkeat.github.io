<p>How on earth does one get to <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,66005,00.html">find solutions to problems of his field, borrowing techniques from a totally different world</a>? Get cross-trained in everything? Get double/triple degrees? Which other fields to &quot;invest&quot; in?</p><p><a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/">Read! Goddamnit!</a> </p><p>And of cos, the sharp-minded skeptic will see through my veiled attempt to qualify the much time I spend reading stuffs <a href="http://www.watchinggooglelikeahawk.com/">totally unrelated to my immediate work</a> everyday. But, if one can be opportunistic about his chances in 4D/Toto, why not a little faith in how <a href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?hl=en&q=%2220%25+time%22+google&meta=">20%-rule type of serendipity</a> can benefit?</p>
