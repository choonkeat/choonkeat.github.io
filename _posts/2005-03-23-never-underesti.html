<p><em>Update: Rectified the title of this entry *sheepish* Didn't realised it was truncated by plog</em></p><p>In a perfect world, a user will give RssFwd a <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">feed url</span> [<a href="http://blog.yanime.org/xml/rss/feed.xml">example</a>] and RssFwd will display a nicely formatted preview [<a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A//blog.yanime.org/rss/rss20/1">example</a>]. At the bottom of the preview page, the user can choose to subscribe by entering his email and submitting a form. Q.E.D.<br /><br />However, this isn't a perfect world, and instead of the <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">feed url</span>, users often give the <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">main url</span> of the site [<a href="http://blog.yanime.org/">example</a>] or anything they see in their browser location bar. For such cases, RssFwd chokes and show an unfriendly page,  <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">&quot;You *****! That's an invalid RSS/Atom feed url!&quot;</span>, and prompts the user to try another url... <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">as if</span> he'll understand now that he's been lectured. And as far as I know, this is apparently the usual behavior of most rss applications - stopping at the scary, but friendly-worded error message.<br /><br />But educating newcomer folks on &quot;How to locate the xml/rss/atom icon&quot;, or &quot;Right-click &gt; copy link&quot; (for feeds that show 'Download/Save-As?' when you click on them [<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/rss.xml">example</a>]) seem like an awfully uphill task; On the other hand, sitting back and relying on the masses to catch-up will only hinder adoption of <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">that RSS thing.</span> Unnecessary delays.<br /><br />So, I guess the easier way is to educate the web-publishers. Since you are publishing feeds already, I'd figure you'll care more. Publishers, (most major blogging tools already does so) make sure your pages carry the <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-FAMILY: courier new,courier,monospace">link ref=alternate</span> tags. Btw, this same tags that lets Firefox show that orange icon on the bottom-right. Such tags allows programs to know that your page has feeds, and what are the feeds.<br /><br />Now, if RssFwd cannot preview a given url, it will autodetect for hidden <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-FAMILY: courier new,courier,monospace">link ref=alternate</span> tags and check to find the actual feed <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">on behalf of the user</span>. Meaning, <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A//blog.yanime.org/1">previewing (a main page)</a> will <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">just work</span> (<a href="http://www.reemer.com/archives/2005/03/17/etech_joel_on_misattribution/index.php">Rule #1</a>). No more errors*.<br /><br />Initially this was done for the benefit of RSS-challenged folks... but I'm beginning to find that.. I'm liking the convenience myself. So, for any webpage, you can dive straight into <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/#previewform">preview</a> - If there's a feed, it'll pick up for ya. No more icon hunting.<br /><br /><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">*Disclaimer: Websites with no RSS/Atom feeds at all </span><a style="FONT-STYLE: italic" href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A//www.google.com/">will still not render</a><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">.</span></p><br />
