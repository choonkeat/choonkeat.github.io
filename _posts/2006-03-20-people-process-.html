<p>I'll leave the point-by-point rebuttal to <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000577.html">other</a> <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/cote/archives/2006/03/mcgovern_comes.html">people</a>... but do have an issue with <a href="http://duckdown.blogspot.com/2006/03/more-thoughts-on-ruby-and-why-it-isnt.html">James McGovern</a>'s claim over #9.</p> <blockquote><p>The [agile] community needs to get their priorities straight. People, then process then tools in that order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>Now that's quite the priority that you'd want to be seen as believing in, ain't it? He's championing for Enterprise Architecture, so I must guess he means to say that's the priority enterprises practise.</p><p>Interesting. </p><p>From the planet that I live in, outsourcing trends is on the rise and expensive software are sold to (and bought by) enterprises. Enterprise software&nbsp; projects are usually built with a <em>few good men</em> as leads, and a farm of programmers. Why outsource your first priority? If something is of last priority, why buy the most expensive? Hence, <strong>say it like it is</strong>, the following priority may reflect what's out there: Tools and Process, <strong>then </strong>People.</p><p>And maybe, if one day... &quot;people&quot; does get prioritized higher... they'd be allowed to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">pick their own tools</a>.<br /></p>
