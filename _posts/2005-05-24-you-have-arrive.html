<p>My friend used to kid that it would be awesome to see illegal hawkers selling pirated CDs of your software product - 'cos it would mean your product <span style="font-style: italic;">has arrived</span>.<br /><br />Now perhaps, we can use cleaner benchmark - <a href="http://blakeross.com/index.php?p=134">be a Jeopardy answer</a>. Gratz Firefox!<br /><br />PS: Hmm.. but considering Jeopardy is for smarty pants, i.e. obscure Q&amp;A, appearing there may mean your product is obscure? Aim for <a href="http://ch8.mediacorptv.com/shows/variety/view/502/1/.html">PSC night</a> perhaps.. <br /><br /></p>
