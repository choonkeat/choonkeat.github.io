<p>After showing <a href="http://sharedcopy.com/">SharedCopy</a> to some people at the <a href="http://www.thedigitalmovement.org/blog/2007/03/13/nexus-2007-come-geekout-with-us/">Geekout</a>, Vu Xuan Linh pointed me to <a href="http://liveurls.mozdev.org/installation.html">the Web Marker</a> firefox extension. My first thought was, argh... feature rat race... </p><p>But after installing and seeing how the extension works, I'm happy to say that <a href="http://www.google.com.sg.sharedcopy.com/a5a2c1842a62ca1276435f1de60c1aa5.html">the two can co-exist</a> quite happily. What other tools are out there that could be complimentary to the service?</p><p>Progress update: </p><ul><li>Bookmarklet is working on IE6</li><li>Comments can be dragged around now (<a href="http://moofx.mad4milk.net/">Moo.fx</a>)</li><li>Public read-only mode</li><li>Copies are version controlled <br /></li></ul>
