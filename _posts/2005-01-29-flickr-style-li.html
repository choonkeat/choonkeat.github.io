<p>For a lack of better phrase, and I don't know who started this - just that I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags">saw it on Flickr first</a> - I've shamelessly copied the presentation of my &quot;List Of Sites&quot; into Flickr-style, instead of the old, boring, usual, row-by-row listing..  *yawns*.. anyways, <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/">check it out</a>! [Updated link on 26 Apr '06]<br /><br />Think I may just put the &quot;You may also like.. &quot; feature soon.. <br /><br />Btw, I'm currently using the following MySQL query to rank the feeds -<br /><br />SELECT<br /><div style="margin-left: 40px">FLOOR(<br /><div style="margin-left: 40px">SUM(<br /><div style="margin-left: 40px">my.num_of_subscribers &gt; your.num_of_subscribers OR <br />(my.num_of_subscribers = your.num_of_subscribers AND my.id &gt; your.id)</div>) / COUNT(*) * 25) + 6 AS rank, </div>SUBSTRING(my.title, 1, 15) AS abbr_title, <br />my.* </div>FROM <br /><div style="margin-left: 40px">feeds my, feeds your <br /></div>WHERE <br /><div style="margin-left: 40px">my.id != your.id AND my.title != '' </div>GROUP BY my.id <br />ORDER BY my.title ASC;<br /><br />That's a mouthful!.. Roughly translate to: <span style="font-style: italic">More subscribers always more popular; if not, newer is more popular</span>. <br /><ul><li>rank: The &quot;/ count(*) ... as rank&quot; is just to make sure that the range is 6 to 31 (font-ready numbers that I can plug directly in the rhtml file)</li><li>abbr_title: not in use yet.. was going to control, because some ppl's blog titles are just too damn long! :-D</li></ul>I couldn't really decide what to do with the feeds that has the same number of subscribers (which happens to be '1' in many cases...) so I chose the lazy option: give the wildcard rankings to new feeds (order by id) so that the rankings will shuffle as new feeds are added - which is likely, since somebody out there is always reading something else.. If I'd given the wildcard rankings to the more frequently updated, then the ranking would've been rather stagnant - personal blogs will never outdo news sites, and news sites has naturally more chance of gaining subscriptions.<br /></p>
