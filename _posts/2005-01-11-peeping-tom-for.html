[click on the images to control the actual camera]<br /><br />Of cos, I do think he did that for fun and the kind of reverse-psycho way that writing <a href="http://airsnort.shmoo.com/">AirSnort</a> [Wireless-Network-Hacking-For-Dummies] will help make wireless network safer by means of &quot;wake up your freaking idea&quot;.<br /><br />Remember to wash your eyes, else see buck chum.<br /><br /><br /></p>
