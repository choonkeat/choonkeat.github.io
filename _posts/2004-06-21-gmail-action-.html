<p> For you faithful googlers and, more precisely, gmail new-loves.. <br /><br /><b>1. GTray</b><br /><br />Shows 'You have XYZ new email at Gmail&quot; thingy on the bottom right of ur Win2k machine.. <br /><a href="http://torrez.us/archives/2004/05/23/000272.html">http://torrez.us/archives/2004/05/23/000272.html</a><br /><br />Note: When keying in your 'Username', omit the '@gmail.com'... <br />Note: Since no source is distributed with it, can't promise its non-spyware.. but its kewl for now. Keep me updated if this changes.<br /><br /><b>2. Use Gmail as Bug/Issue Tracking System</b><br /><br />This one, suggested by my good friend Kiansheng, whom has evolved from using ICQ logs to track issues (really, that's his main criteria for selection which IM client to use)<br /><br /><blockquote>created labels 'Unresolved', 'In Progress' and 'Resolved' and send<br /> memos to myself.. gmail neatly apply labels to the entire conversation<br /> instead of individual entries...<br /><br />of coz it doesn't have a autogenerate bug # and other things like<br /><span>priority, etc.. but that's enuf of a mobile <span id="st" name="st" class="st0">bugzilla</span> for me... :)</span><br /><span></span></blockquote><span><br />Any more bright ideas? Do fill me in :-D<br /></span></p>
