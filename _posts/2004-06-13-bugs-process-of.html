<p> Fiddling with bugzilla just now.. and was contemplating on creating a button for our QA team to click on (instead of going to Bugzilla's enter bug directly)<br /><br />This button will trigger a process to<br /><br /><ol><li>Place a unique stamp on log</li><li>Generates a URL (to view the log at the stamp, and -500 lines before it)</li><li>Redirects to bugzilla's enter new bug page, with the URL pre-filled into the bug description field.</li></ol>Kewl.. this would be awfully useful to the developer receiving the bug.. Rather than trying to replicate the error and looking at the logs he'd <i>generated </i>for answers.. the developer might as well visit the log of the <i>original </i>incident directly..<br /><br />But...<br /><br /> Not all bugs would potentially have useful hints in the logs ya?.. what if the log rotates dammit.. my viewer has to cater to that - dammit.. my viewer/stamper would be deployment specific.. and also, while I'm at saving the developer's time (avoid having to repeat the steps described)... I might as well save the QA's time in describing his steps in the first place?<br /><br />I mean, the QA is using a computer ya? A computer knows and can record everything that goes through it, ya? Why not have a<br /><ol><li>Middle-layer sniffer to capture all to-fro traffic.. and a viewer counterpart that is able to (guess-timate) reproduce each originating (form fields prefilled)/resultant HTML page.. (how about javascripts on forms?)<br /></li><li>QA-specific-browser that records the buttons clicked, etc..  (how about browser compatibility?)</li><li>QA-tool that wraps any browser to collect data.. (big engineering effort? how about playback?)<br /></li><li>Plugins to browsers to collect such data and counterpart plugins to playback such data?</li></ol>The QA's steps would thus be reduced to<br /><ol><li>Click 'Start Test Case'</li><li>Go about doing his thing,.. and some error occurs<br /></li><li>Click 'Report Bug' <br /></li><li>Go back to Step #1 to proceed with other things<br /></li></ol>All the back-end Bugzilla-like stuffs of opening bug, issue tracking, logging, recording steps, notifying developer could be automated at Step #3.. I'm not seasoned in the field of testing.. I haven't even tried *gasp* JUnit.. and I'm not sure if a company like Mercury Interactive would've already had something like that.. <br /><br />But I would believe I can use something like that.<br /></p>
