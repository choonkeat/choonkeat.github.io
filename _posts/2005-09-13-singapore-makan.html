<p>Now that <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> is showing Singapore nicely.. I've marked a few good eating spots I frequent :-) <br /><br />
<br /><br />
<a href="http://blog.yanime.org/singapore/Singapore_Makan_Places.kmz">Download this KMZ file</a>, double click and open with your installed Google Earth.. and you can see the locations "Singapore Makan Places" :-) <br/>
<br/>
<b>Update:</b> Don't just download, follow the <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/singapore/singapore_makan_places.html">flash demo</a> instead... Sorry!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Please feel free to update, and send me back more locations! Always love a good meal. Maybe there should be more details like actual address.. open hours.. anyways! Share with me yah? There's got to be more...<br/>
