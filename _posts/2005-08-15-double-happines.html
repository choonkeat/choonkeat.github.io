<p>I was surviving on my printed-long-time-ago-on-recycled-paper Ruby Programming (<a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/book/">1st Edition</a>)... <br/>

<br/>
Then last weekend, Borders threw 30% discount for people who bothered to cut coupons like NTUC aunties... <br/>

<br/>Love had intended to use it for <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/">Freakonomics</a>... but since mine is more expensive, its more worthwhile to use it on mine... besides I offered to pay hers.. hmm.. hmmm? what did that 30% discount do for me, again? Who cares!?<br/>
<br/>
And today, as I'm glancing lovingly at my <span style="font-style: italic;">preciousssss</span>, new Pickaxe.. my <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/">Rails book</a> arrived! <br/>
