<p>Finally! Google Translate <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_releases_ajax_language_api.php">gets API-ed</a>. I was glad to see a &quot;detect&quot; method provided - meaning you tell what language a piece of text is in. Weird that the actual Google Translate service <em>still doesn't</em> use it to improve their form defaults.</p>

<p>So I gave my old &quot;<a href="http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2005/12/translate-from.html">Tryanslator</a>&quot; (try and translate) an update, and <a href="http://dev.choonkeat.com/js/lang/index">a new home</a>:<br /><a title="Tryanslator v2 by choonkeat, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/choonkeat/2351050091/"><img width="500" height="269" border="0" alt="Tryanslator v2" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3189/2351050091_ea47be79f3.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Few notes</p>

<ul><li>No asking of &quot;Translate From?&quot; - if you don't know how to read it, you probably don't know what it is written in.</li>

<li>Language to &quot;Translate to&quot; defaults to user's browser language.</li>

<li>Language options are written in their own language (duh).</li>

<li>Google provides a rigid list of &quot;translation pair&quot; (i.e. English to Chinese, but not Chinese to Spanish). Tryanslator2 does an extra bounce to Google's server, using English as the mid-way to obtain a any-to-any translation.</li>

<li>No submit button, just type and wait.</li>

<li>All important text on the page auto-translate themselves to the reader's language, including &quot;Please wait...&quot; :-)</li></ul>
