<p> <p>Did many quiet updates to RssFwd itself lately, hope nothing breaks - its been a few weeks already so I guess not.</p> <p>Most obvious is the update to the footer of the email template, as well as making clustered emails work even better <em>(I can't seem to dig up who suggested this update - whoever it was, sorry its taken this long. Thanks for the suggestions!)</em> :</p> <p> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/choonkeat/346066485/"><img width="240" height="190" border="0" alt="RssFwd: New, Gmail-Friendly Template" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/144/346066485_230c349d04_m.jpg" /></a> </p><p>Also, <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/06/02/important_change_to_the_link_tag">auto-discovery</a> of web pages with multiple feeds <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogcritics.org%2Farchives%2F2007%2F01%2F02%2F174358.php">work better now</a>. </p><p>Happy New Year!&nbsp;</p><p>Update: And oh ya, a long-time wishlist: doesn't choke on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/">xml:base</a> now... meaning links in <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tbray.org%2Fongoing%2F">some Atom feeds</a> should be properly unravelled hence.<br /></p></p>
