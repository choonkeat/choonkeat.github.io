<p>Made some optimisation yesterday - confirmed the results over the past day - RssFwd is faster on its feet now. This should satisfy most folks that are unsure of choosing RssFwd because of the poll interval being too long:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Sites are polled for updates approximately every hour (6-12 hours for torrent sites)</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
This quote below used to run in my randomized email signature. How true indeed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>&quot;All programming is an exercise in caching.&quot; - Terje Mathisen</blockquote><br/>
And sorry to torrent folks have to give way for regular folks like me reading text. Besides, I'm sure if <a href="http://s90215429.onlinehome.us/sjvilla79/blog/2005/07/using-gmail-to-find-downloads-on.html">Gmail is only used to store-and-find torrent seeds</a>, you guys can be gracious enough to give more resources to fellow subscribers with simpler needs of keeping track on <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Findex.rss">Slashdot</a>, <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A//radio.weblogs.com/0001011/rss.xml">The Scobleizer</a>, <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A//feeds.feedburner.com/boingboing/iBag">Boing Boing</a>, <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A//tomorrow.sg/">Tomorrow.sg</a> and the like.<br/>
