<p>Apparently <a href="http://operawatch.blogspot.com/2005/07/opera-adds-support-for-bit-torrent.html">Opera browser is embedding</a> a Bittorrent client in its next version. Kewl. Hopefully other browsers follow suit.<br/>
<br/>
But that's it. Until web servers becomes Bittorrent capable themselves, Bittorrent will remain more a software than a protocol. Otherwise, it'll be smooth and transparent like <a href="http://webreference.com/internet/software/servers/http/compression/3.html">HTTP compression headers</a> that most of us already benefit from without even realising its there.<br/>
<br/>
And from the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/bramcohen/6531.html">bickering</a>, looks like nothing is going to change (Maybe it'll take a MS implementation to Apache into action?).<br/></p>
