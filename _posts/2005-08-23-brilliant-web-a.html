<p>I'm no expert in calendar applications, but I'm very tempted to say, this must be the most brilliant web-based calendar I've seen: <a href="http://nat.org/2005/august/hula.html">Hula web interface</a>. Drag-drop date/time, duration, faded borders, in-place editing.. brilliant!<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://hula-project.org/Hula_Server">Hula Project</a>, btw, is <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>a calendar and mail server whose goal is to be fun and easy to use, while scaling effortlessly from small groups to large organizations with thousands of members.<br/>
<br/>
Hula is an open source project led by <a href="http://www.novell.com/">Novell</a> </blockquote><br/></p>
