<p>Was chatting with my friend the other day.. and he complained that there's no easy to use drag-drop capability in web technology.. well, you can with a signed applet - apparently <a href="http://www.radinks.com/upload/applet.php">some other company</a> already has a working product that does that.. just that its very ugly and cost money.<br /><br />Hence, I shall embark on yet-another &quot;because there should be better&quot; journey.. and do something like that, open sourced. Maybe a addon to <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/jupload/">J'upload</a> so as to minimize the wheel-reinvented. Let me know if anyone's interested to do the shit work.<br /><br />The motto of the applet will be.. &quot;<i>Uploading, the way it should've been since day-1</i>&quot; (So, maybe its name is UTWISBSD1) Its aim.. so highly configurable, it should outright replace the icky &quot;Browse&quot; button.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /></p>
