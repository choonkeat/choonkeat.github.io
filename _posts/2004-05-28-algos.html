<p>I do <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4960">like</a> <a href="http://loaf.cantbedone.org/">LOAF</a>.. it has a very interesting idea of using Bloom Filters to sort importance of email (extendable to resolve spam?). Something about it just nags me that there's a bigger use for it.. Do check it out!<br /><br />The BSP-tree was also brought to fame by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack">John Carmack</a>'s DOOM engine.  TODO list, &quot;Must get hands on kewl algos and make them famous too&quot;<br /><br /></p>
