<p> Was looking around for an isometric chat engine (using flash, specifically).. and am quite perturb that isn't any serious projects that is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">freely</a> available. How sad.. to think that one has to create his or her own isometric thingy -from scratch - everytime there's a need to use it? <br /><br />Anyways.. got my lazy butt off to doing a scratch bit.. if anyone's interested, see if my program (<a title="Y-anime" href="http://www.yanime.org/y-anime.zip">download Y-Anime</a>) would be a useful kick start.. Hopefully I'll get around improving it often. You can preview <a title="Y-anime" href="http://www.yanime.org/y-anime.swf">here</a>.<br /><br />Its late and I'm famished!!!<br /><br /> <br /></p>
