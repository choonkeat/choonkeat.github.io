<p>Don't ask me how to pronounce it. Ask the British :-P at <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">djangoproject.com</a>. A quick look through the docs and stuff (no 10 minute video -sulk-) seems to show that this framework <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">gets it</span> as well. Some differences of cos (some would argue big differences), but generally its heart warming to see the trend of framework-works-for-developer (rather than developer-works-for-framework) picks up... aka &quot;<a href="http://www.jrandolph.com/blog/?p=8">Web 3.0 Frameworks</a>&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I hope Rails learns to play with Django and they'll not smite each other (if not friends, don't be enemies). The world <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> big enough. A combined message from different camps will be more resounding <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=35202">than any one camp trying to say he is the bestest</a> - and coming off as naive or clueless.<br/></p>
