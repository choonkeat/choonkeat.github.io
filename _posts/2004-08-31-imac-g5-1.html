<p>Love pass me this link: http://www.apple.com/imac/ (brand new, hot from the oven!)<br /><br />My initial thoughts goes something like &quot;.. they've departed from the original iMac all-in-one design.. now this looks just like any other G5.. &quot; only for a moment there.. perhaps the webpage did a little cough and begged my attention further.. there is no CPU!<br /><br />One can argue that the first iMac are candy drops and looks much cuter blah blah.. but i like this one very much.<br /><br />iMac v1.0 shames the PC hardware designers. iMac v2.0 shames the Laptop &amp; PC hardware designers. Makes u look differently at your notebook now, aye?<br /><br /></p>
