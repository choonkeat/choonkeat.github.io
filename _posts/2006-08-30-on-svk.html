<p>Version control is the best thing since sliced bread (for those whom have <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/timemachine.html">just learnt of it</a>). But once <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/scm/scm_branches.html">branching</a> comes into the picture, it is becomes a <a href="../../articles/2006/05/24/version-control-that-missing-module-in-cs101">hairy</a> thing. </p><p>It might be because humans aren't accustomed to think in terms of parallel universe (perhaps sci-fi authors). There appears to have no &quot;<em>one right way</em>&quot; to cater for all scenarios. I used to live and breath on the <em>trunk-is-stable-and-latest</em> camp (half sneering at enterprisey people who '<em>branch first</em><em>, then merge</em>'). But it just happens that my past situations only requires so much.<br /> </p><p>Furthermore, some people just prefer the branch-merge-often mentality, others thrive in simplicity of trunk-work-branch-maintain workflow. Like tea people and coffee people. Just different. No point converting anyone over to the other side. Hence I was dabbling to create a script (on-top-of <a href="http://www.dellroad.org/svnmerge/index">svnmerge</a>) to provide dead-simple branch/merge workflow - so trunk ppl can have it so, and branch ppl won't be inconvenienced.<br /></p><p>That's when I found <a href="http://svk.elixus.org/">SVK</a>. By saying its a &quot;<em>decentralized version control system built with the Subversion filesystem</em>&quot; is really really doing it a huge disservice. My layman version would be &quot;<em>SVK lets you be the branch-merge person you are inside, or the trunk-branch, or watever *%^#$ person you like to do your work in - whilst sharing a common repository with people of different taste! I mean, its like a cup that lets you sip coffee, sit around with everyone, whilst sharing the same pot of tea!</em>&quot;<br /></p><p>SVK has more commands to do magic, but the daily stuff closely resembles SVN: svk commit; svk update; svk diff. It also has another benefit - it doesn't pollute your working directory with hidden <em>.svn</em> or <em>CVS</em> folders/files. <a href="http://thegrok.wordpress.com/">Some ppl</a> are irked by that. Those files are consolidated in your home directory. Actually that might be good / bad depending on you being a tea or coffee person.<br /></p><p>The only drawback is that IDE integration is lacking at the moment. And most importantly, the tickets / changesets information on <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> wouldn't tally directly with my local mirror.<br /></p><p>Oh well, these might not be show stopper after all. Let's see how it goes when I use it for real.<br /></p>
