<p> Wow. Feels like being let out of jail. It has been a pretty long time since I have a peaceful weekend. Yes, not working this week. Today I woke at 12:45pm.. read the papers, Recruit section too.. lunch with my mom and built my <a href="http://www.stikfas.com/products.html">STIKFAS</a> dragon and watched Discovery channel - which coincidentally Love is gonna be working at, yea! - and hang out with my friends, get suckered into playing mahjong because there-ain't-a-lot-else-to-do-in-their-house and lost some money... ya, life sure seem back to the way it was.<br /><br />Mental note: I must stop being suckered to mahjong in the future. I appreciate the game, more fun than Big2.. but I know I'll definitely lose money. So, gambling is unarguably out.<br /><br />Anyways, printed and read <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">an article written by Paul Graham</a> recommended by my sinseh, <br /><br /><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Don't be put off by the title. It's not just about programmers, languages, etc.<br />It broaches on many subjects which make my heart string resonate. Enjoy!<br /></div><br />It really is an excellent read and how much I wish more people gets the message! .. -sigh-. Btw, time to intro my sinseh.. <br /> Though he doesn't like me addressing him as sinseh but that's the way its gonna be. Cheewai. I think he's quite an extraordinaire.. first of all, he was willing to spend time inspiring a total stranger, ignorant idiot like me what the <a href="http://iroi.seu.edu.cn/books/ee_dic/whatis/hacker.htm">hacker</a> world is.. he was the person that taught me what a :-) smiley is - Woah! Next, he completes his masters in UK and dashes to <a href="http://www.gov.bw/home.html">Botswana</a> to help setup their IT infrastructure.. went to UN.. and now back at Botswana. What a kewl dude!<br /><br />The next inspiration has to go to The Guan.. whom would entertain many of my out-of-classroom can-i-do-this queries with, &quot;in theory, everything can be done&quot; and promptly showed me the prowers of unix. At a time when its fashionable to be I-don't-give-grades-a-hoot.. he inspired the programmer in us to not just achieve.. but to out-do ourselves and each other..  and achieve &quot;elegance in code&quot;. Its a pity they don't teach Lisp anymore. car car cdr cdr, cdr cdr car.. <br /><br />Mental note: Curiosity - Thou shalt not lose the spirit to ask, inquire and be the dumb one.<br /><br /></p>
