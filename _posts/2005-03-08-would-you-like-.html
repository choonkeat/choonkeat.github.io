<p>Co-Surfing. Quite interesting.. a more interactive extension to 3rd Voice (if any of you still remembers.. it was year 2000..)<br /><br />This company Jybe has done a toolbar for both IE and Firefox (Yay!) unfortunately requires lousy Internet-v1.0-style registration and newsletters checkboxes and blah.<br /><br />Anyways, was looking for a demo before installing. No luck. So decided to do my own. Check it out here: <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/_doc/Jybe_Review.htm">Jybe Demo</a> [swf, dis-coloring due to optimized swf filesize..], and see if you like it - for business use (e.g. real-time website design approval with clients) or personal use (e.g. can't think of yet)<br /><br />I think it'll be better if participants don't have to &quot;join&quot; a session like now. Its a learning/adoption hurdle. A better interface than &quot;click join &gt; enter <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">name</span> &gt; enter <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">channel</span>&quot;.. is a special URL I can easily pass to another person - &quot;Hey check this out, http://..... &quot; - for he/she to click on, and immediately we're co-surfing (assuming toolbar installed on both parties). Of cos, &quot;assuming toolbar installed&quot; is a hurdle itself, but that's deployment issue.<br /><br />And knowing that our browsing is going through a 3rd party server is quite sucky, especially for <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">business</span> use. While we're at installing toolbars already, I don't see why we can't take a step towards P2P.</p>
