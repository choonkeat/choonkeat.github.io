<p>Something interesting at sgBlog today, a <a href="http://www.sgblog.com/component/option,com_simpleboard/Itemid,0/func,view/id,181/catid,12/">Games Developing seminar</a> at NUS on this Friday. What's more interesting, is the find of a game named <a href="http://www.envisagereality.com./">Immortals</a> ... quite pretty I think, though my friend commented <span style="font-style: italic;">but this kind of game is outdated le.. now is lan game.. </span>he's the DOTA kind of guy. Anyhoo, go watched the pretty game trailer.. done by some impressive people in their own right, e.g. <a href="http://www.shawnye.com/">Shawn Ye</a> and <a href="http://www.dominicqwek.com/">Dominic Qwek</a><br/></p>
