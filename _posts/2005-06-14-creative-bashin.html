<p><a href="http://www.fantasmal.com/blog/archives/45-Creative-should-just-give-up.html">grok</a> throws his hands at Creative once <a href="http://www.fantasmal.com/blog/archives/34-Hardware-Darwinism.html">again</a>, I wonder what triggered this morning - he must be using some sick tool. But anyways.. I'm just looking for the day of great humor when Creative declares feature support for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pod</span>casting. Hurhur. Btw, with even iTunes supporting podcasts, any mp3 player released here on without the following features will be deemed obsolete: <span style="font-style: italic;">(Maybe such features are already there, I don't know.. I'm still stuck at my 128mb toy.)</span><br />
<ol><br />
    <li>Continue playing where it stopped (can you say &quot;CD player&quot; ?)</li><br />
    <li>Allow to bookmark (1 or many) locations</li><br />
    <li>Fast forward - fast. Not in trickles of seconds</li><br />
</ol><br />
Anything else to add?<br />
<p><br />
PS: Oh <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/06/13/ingame_bookavatar_de.html">Second Life</a> is looking <a href="http://secondlife.blogs.com/nwn/2005/06/evolving_nemo.html">more</a> and more interesting..<br />
