<p>People championing &quot;simple&quot;: 37signals, Tumblr, Twitter, Apple (supposedly)<br />People championing &quot;more feature sells&quot;: Joel Spolsky, JND, ... </p>

<p>Whilst I appreciate the numbers from JND.org, I must confess I'd prefer it if the Simple-is-better camp is right.</p>

<p>My own hypothesis is that simplicity only shows its value over time. </p>

<p>When first contacting computers, you love its complexity - you could do so much!, then upon using it, you love it that you could change this, this that, this that, and everything! Try this! and this! and this!... after years of using, and migrating to-from many computers.. you start to yearn simplicity. Pain of learning becomes obvious and pronounced.</p>

<p>Huh? Computers and a few years? People uses fridge, washing machines for decades! House-hold items! But the actual interaction between a person and a house-hold item would probably not be more than a month. </p>

<p>So maybe, when change is expected, people prefer simple. </p>

<p>i.e. If [<em>I perceive</em>] this is not forever, I'd prefer not learning anything (+1 simplicity). If [<em>I perceive</em>] I'm gonna be stuck with it, it better be able to deal with anything that will ever arise (+1 feature)</p>
