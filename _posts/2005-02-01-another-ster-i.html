<p> Just when I've finally <a href="/articles/2005/01/12/voice-over-ip-is-here">boarded the Skype boat to work</a> with overseas colleagues, <a href="http://www.bellster.net/web/OverView">Bellster</a> comes out with an even more wicked architecture - plainly speaking:<br /><br /><div style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;May I borrow your phone? I m in Australia and I need to<br />call somebody in your town. If you let me, I ll<br />just reach across the Internet and place my call.&quot;<br /></div><p><br />Of cos, like all other care-and-share schemes that we're all familiar with (Nap<span style="font-style: italic;">-<span style="font-weight: bold;">ster</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">,</span> Kazaa,.. even antique BBS..) the whole idea is &quot;share and you get&quot;. But since this one is closely money related, it is useful to be reminded that what you share and what you get is totally different: <span style="font-weight: bold;">share local call time = get IDD call time</span>.<br /><br />But before we people get too excited, better wait and see <a href="http://james.seng.sg/archives/2005/01/31/thoughts_on_bellster.html">how Big Brother may decide</a>. This could <strong style="font-weight: normal;">very possibly</strong> be yet-another <a href="http://www.idfuel.com/index.php?p=197&more=1&c=1">very nice but don't do it here</a> invention.. <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">*soft wailing*.. I want my segway... </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"><font color="#000000">Btw, I'm quite curious if the <a href="http://james.seng.sg/archives/2005/01/31/thoughts_on_bellster.html">mentioned</a> IDA SBO Licensing Guideline [<a href="http://www.ida.gov.sg/idaweb/doc/download/I190/SBO_Guidelines-8Sep2004.pdf">pdf</a>] applies to people who purposely leave their home's wireless broadband open for others to use.. (yes, there are such kind people)</font></span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"><br /></span></p></p>
