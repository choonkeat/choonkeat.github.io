<p> Am looking into databases that can be <span style="font-weight: bold;">easily</span> distributed with our company product. Fuss free, worry free, blah. The current product relies on Oracle/MySQL setup. It stores many states/configs etc stuff. But the question is, why does an app server <span style="font-weight: bold;">require</span> a database? Applications requires database, that's understandable.. but the app server? Install is not enough? I need a something else (db) installed and configured before this thing runs??<br /><br />So, I embark on a (personal?) journey to pick the lightest, appropriate solution to act as the app server's internal datastore - separate from the datastore that the application developers will be using. The aim is to magically remove dependency of a database (perception) but still continue to operate as-per-normal.<br /><br />First I found <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/04/10/27/0459213.shtml?tid=221&tid=198&tid=136&tid=108&tid=8&tid=2">Cloudscape and IBM's big-fan-fare release</a> of <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/derby/">Derby</a>.. then <a href="http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net/">HSQLDB</a> starts propping up from under the carpet (eh, its inside my JBoss directory.. didn't know that).. then I'm greatly humbled and eternally grateful for <a href="http://technology.amis.nl/blog/index.php?p=203">this article</a>, &quot;Talk on Open Source Databases&quot;. Anyone shopping for a DB should look through the slides.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><br /></span><a href="http://technology.amis.nl/blog/index.php?p=203"></a></p>
