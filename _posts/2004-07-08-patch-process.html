<p><a href="http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/Microsoft_patch_process.html">Patching</a> seems to be a slower process than cracking. <br /><br />Now, isn't that so oxymoron-ly unnecessary? You wrote the affected software, you got the code. Can't companies write a better, faster spreading &quot;virus&quot; to patch 'em? Duh.<br /><br />Need sleep.. shutting down.. <br /><br /></p>
