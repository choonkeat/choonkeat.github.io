<p>Damn good stunt from Scoble (but cannot pull this everyday).. <br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/10/01.html#a11313">Hey Ballmer or Gates, can I make an acquisition?</a><br/>
</div><br />
<br/>
Whatever the outcome, he's gotten so many ppl guessing aloud (<a href="http://web2.0central.com/archives/73">example</a>).. that the discussions would've generated sufficient research &amp; ideas, including free public feedback poll to self-fulfil even if there weren't any target to start with.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is... <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/who_does_scoble_want_microsoft_to_buy.php">not 37signals</a> please.<br/></p>
