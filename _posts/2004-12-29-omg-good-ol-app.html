<p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/28/web_based_apple_2_em.html">BoingBoing</a> has a link to a <a href="http://www.virtualapple.com/">site allowing you to run Apple II emulator on your browser</a>! (Windows + IE only). It has decks of programs, the originals! It even has my long-lost game... I'd missed so much... playing at my brother's friend's house,.. 8 person cramming for controls on 1 keyboard.... multi-player the old fashion way.... <a href="http://www.virtualapple.com/dogfightdisk.html">Dogfight</a>! Just spent the last half-hour re-discovering the keys and dog fighting! Checkout the silly parachutes when the planes are shot! KAWAYI NEH! Ultimate nostalgia!<br /><br />Of cos, kids will probably <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/28/smartass_kids_slammi.html">think its super lame</a>. But they don't know do they?<br /><br /><br /></p>
