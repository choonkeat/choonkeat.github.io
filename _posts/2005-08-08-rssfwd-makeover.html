<p>Pushed by some angel advise and blessed with Love's approval... <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd">Rssfwd</a> now sports a look-and-feel makeover. Feel free to feedback in the comments :-D (and yes, that pixelated art is <span style="font-style: italic;">intentional</span>)<br/>
<br/>
I don't suppose its designer quality yet. But at least it doesn't look as sloppy as before. Now, that I've gotten that out of the door - time to do some cool useful features!<br/>
<br/>
PS: In case you didn't notice, rssfwd now has its own domain name. <br/>
PS: In case you didn't notice, there's now 12,500 results for 'rssfwd' search on Google now. Yippie!<br/></p>
