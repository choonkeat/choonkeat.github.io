<p>The long awaited migration (parts at a time) of the rssfwd operations is taking place. I'll try to reduce the downtime<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, if you have any inbox filters setup pls filter the from email address as only &quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">rssfwd</span>&quot;... excluding the full address &quot;@yanime.org&quot;. As the migration also means that yanime.org and rssfwd.com will be separate servers now, you'll be getting emails from a different email address hence.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about that. This should be the last of email changes for rssfwd.<br/></p>
