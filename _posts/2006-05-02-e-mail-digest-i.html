<p>  <p>Keep up to date through out the day? Have a 1-look overview of all updates? Pick 1. That's what &quot;email digests&quot; means. You get to read only 1 single email containing all the updates - BUT you only get them at the end of the day. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/19/feedburner-will-dominate-blog-to-email/">That may suit some people</a>, but not me.<br />  </p>   <p>So RssFwd has a new feature today. Introducing a clustered view that allow readers to have the best of both worlds! With the help from Gmail of course (and any other e-mail program that has grown up to implement threading intelligently). To enable, just tick the &quot;clustered&quot; option at preview page.<br /></p>   <p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/choonkeat/138799309/"><img width="500" height="116" border="0" alt="RssFwd messages clustered in Gmail" src="http://static.flickr.com/48/138799309_8b415decd1.jpg" /></a></p>   <p>You get the benefit of keeping up to date wheneva you want to - the individual updates just keeps flowing in as individual emails. Additionally, you get the benefit of a reading everything on a single page when you choose to (end of day, start of day, end of week,... your pick!) </p> <p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/choonkeat/138816194/"><img width="233" height="500" border="0" alt="RssFwd messages clustered in Gmail (inside)" src="http://static.flickr.com/56/138816194_a691e92c70.jpg" /></a></p>   <p>RssFwd is attempting to de-throne <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/">Google's own</a>, /cackle, and be the defacto RSS reader on Gmail. Hm, then again.. Google Reader was never meant to integrate with Gmail was it?<br />  </p></p>
