<p>Over the weekend, the company went for a <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/lexec.php?op=LexLink&lexicon=lexicon&keyword=KELONG&page=1">Kelong</a> trip in Malaysia. Though we're all very busy, rushing for deadlines (and me rushing to finish my stuff on hand, to hand over before taking on my new job - damn.. should've placed a few days of rest in-between stop and start of work.. ) the trip was a go ahead.. probably because we know we'll never go anywhere if we'd delay it for any occasion.<br /><br />Its never been so HOT!? 34 degrees I think.. but it surely felt more.. adding to that, there were - not surprisingly - nothing to do in the Kelong.. plus the sweltering weather making you too sticky to play or rest... it was not exactly a blissful trip.. However, there were pockets of fun.. I'd guess its the people that counts, not the destination.<br /><br />Anyways.. any idea how a kelong is built? Anyone?<br /><br /></p>
