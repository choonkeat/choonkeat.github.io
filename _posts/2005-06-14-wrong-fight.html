<p><a href="http://news.zdnet.com/Open-source+LAMP+a+beacon+to+developers/2100-3513_22-5744767.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdnn">LAMP is good?</a> You agree? I agree. My last 3 companies are all on LAMP. The LAMP combo (<span style="font-weight: bold;">L</span>inux, <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>pache, <span style="font-weight: bold;">M</span>ySQL, <span style="font-weight: bold;">P</span>HP/Perl/Python)&nbsp; powered countless dotcoms (and many ISVs even now) and is accepted by most folks as a decent and cheap server setup. Good starting point?<br/>
<br/>
Even Java folks are comfortable to acknowledge, &quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">LAMP is an enabling, agile combo, but for enterprise systems [insert keywords of scalability,&nbsp; web services, BEPL]..</span>.&quot; whatever.. so, bottom line is LAMP is not necessarily <i>excellent</i>, but <span style="font-weight: bold;">good enough</span>?<br/>
<br/>
Also, agree with me that its kewl to replace the &quot;P&quot; with basically anything you like aye? Some people like Perl. Some people prefer Python. Agree? Whichever the case, LAMP is LAMP - its light, cheap (free!) and good. Oh! and some will add Tomcat, and use Java - LAM* <span style="font-style: italic;">bah!</span> - still the same: light, cheap and good. Agree?<br/>
<br/>
Why then, may I ask, that when I mention <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a> does the <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/04/1520227&amp;from=rss">weather look <span style="font-style: italic;">different</span></a>? Can it scale? Does it support 2-phase commits? Transactions? Speed? Sheesh. Now when did those demeaning questions pop up in discussions of LAMP? I just changed the &quot;P&quot; didn't I? LAMP is still LAMP? Or is it now no more?<br/>
<br/>
In fact, its a LAMP+ (read: plus a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22nobody+has+done+it+like+this%22+rails">thought out development framework</a>, out of the box, ready for use)<br/>
<br/>
Now LAMP doesn't come with a framework - that missing last mile? - build your own, collect, assemble into what your team of developers can use to churn out web applications after web applications.. lemme see, where do we-the-new-startup begin? Ok, let's do... The Login framework! oh yes, we need some database wrappers that we can - <span style="font-style: italic;">check this out</span> - reuse! DIY. BYO. Yay!<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'd figure what the difference is - wrong fight. Any discussion on Rails leading to J2EE and scaling should be henceforth be halted, stopped - not a word spoken more. Instead, civil discussions should come from the angle of &quot;Why choose LAMP and start with zero?&quot; After you'd install LAMP you can't groovy yet.. but after you have installed Rails, it would've scaffolded you high enough to develop those apps, <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/20/rails.html">straightaway</a>. Any new adopters to LAMP should be rescued from Web1.0 hazards, and nourished in Rails.<br/>
<br/>
PS: It is often easier to scale up, than scale down. And when one tries to scale down its kitchen sink (i.e. become agile) - they <a href="http://www.bea.com/framework.jsp?CNT=index.htm&amp;FP=/content/products/aqualogic/#">gotta throw it all away</a>. Now, why would you want to scale down? Go figure - only thing is, when you do, just don't start from zero.<br/>
