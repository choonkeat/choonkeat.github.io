<p> <p>I've been dabbling with content, syndication and stuff for a while now.. and this just blows my mind: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Pipes</a> . Didn't blog about it yesterday because the site was overwhelmed, and you would've only gotten &quot;Unable to reach website&quot;.. anyways..<br /></p> <p>What is it about? I wouldn't be able <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/02/pipes_and_filte.html">to describe it like Tim O'Reilly has</a>, but its basically Yahoo! Pipes lets you treat any feed as a source of data, add filters, conversions, sort, truncate, combine them into some output that pleases you.</p> <p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/choonkeat/384332445/"><img width="240" height="108" border="0" alt="Screenshot" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/148/384332445_6b1e7c66a3_m.jpg" /></a></p> <p>Meaning, I can probably do things like ask for your name, put that into a Pipe that plucks your wishlist off Thinkgeek (or your blog), get a list of those items selling on ebay, filter them against the cheapest finds on Froogle and viola - a cheapest possible gift for a friend! Anyways, or use the Pipes to do some other sick thing you can think of.</p> <p>All drag and drop. Very spectacular, sleek, browser-based UI. +1 geek point to Yahoo!</p> <p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/choonkeat/384333808/"><img width="240" height="174" border="0" alt="Screenshot-1" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/98/384333808_dad0287295_m.jpg" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Update: After playing for a little while, it makes you wish you could have more Operators, e.g. truncate a string, etc... and it'll just be horrible to wait for Yahoo! to keep up with the requests.. hopefully there'll be a plugin mechanism for that, like DabbleDB's innovative approach of <a href="http://dabbledb.com/help/guides/pluginapi/">plug-outs</a>.<br /></p></p>
