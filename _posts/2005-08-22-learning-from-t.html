<p>Ok, last night's Apprentice (the GT4 graffiti episode) taught me something. Something <i>more</i> this time... because I lost. Or at least it almost felt like it. When the task was revealed, I had (in my mind) come up with almost the exact design of the losing team!! And though the post-production editing gave me hints which team was going to win... I just couldn't be <i>convinced</i> - and upon hearing the Sony guys &quot;<i>knew clearly</i>&quot; which was the winning team.. &quot;<i>it was obvious</i>&quot;... I was even more puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing the interviewed members of the focus groups talking about how they like the winning designs better, etc... I realised I'd known nothing about those consumer's concerns - and I'm a consumer. I even played (and love) GT3.<br/>
<br/>
So, before I get into yet another design-revamp-launch-get-feedback-that-its-ugly cycle.. I guess I better show you guys (my focus groups) a mock up of the spanking new, more professional looking RssFwd design.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think: <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/mockup/index.html" style="">Minimalistic Design #1</a>.<br/>

Some FAQ:<br/>
<ol><br />
    <li><b>Where did the ads go?</b> Well.. I haven't found a good place to put them without sacrificing asthetics, so perhaps until then, it'll be donations only.</li><br />
    <li><b>Where's all the info?</b> I'll stick them properly into the various sub pages, with the same font as &quot;Enter a feed URL to subscribe&quot; - and rid myself of silly less-pages-is-better mantra.. <br/>
    </li><br />
    <li><b>What's with the picture - RssFwd isn't a desktop app?!</b> Actually, I'm intending RssFwd to be a desktop app - to relieve myself of some bandwidth/load... besides I think the browser-inside-browser-infinite thing is hilarious (Love didn't think so)</li><br />
