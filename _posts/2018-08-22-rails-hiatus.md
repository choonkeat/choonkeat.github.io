title: Rails Hiatus

I’ve had the good fortune to work full-time as a [Go](https://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism) developer for the past two years. I love it and will foreseeably continue to choose Go for all things server side.

The side effect of that is: I didn’t touch Ruby on Rails for a long, long time.

I’m pretty sure I would’ve LOL’d at that statement — *Hello!? Ruby is the most succinct and Englishy readable programming language!<sup>[[1]](#footnote1)</sup>* — before my Rails hiatus.

Turns out, I’ve been carrying loads of latent Rails knowledge, non-stop, in my head, ever since I first picked it up in 2004! I guess Rails was a smaller project then, I watched *that* 15 minute video, and learnt enough to get dangerous, kept exploring and learning, updating myself as versions were released, and everything was just in my head.

But now, apparently those knowledge [paged out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(computer_memory)). Revisiting and troubleshooting old Rails project without those memory pages is not easy. The implicit links between different parts of the software, the innocently overwritten methods that makes a database call (or not?), the hard to find keys and values that will set things to behave this way or that — I feel like a new boyfriend at the class gathering; can’t keep up with all the unspoken words and inside jokes.

If I have a Rails-shaped web app<sup>[[2]](#footnote2)</sup> to MVP today, I may still go with Rails, but I'll likely only wield the parts of which the spells I still remember. The boring parts. But hey, boring rails code is the best rails code, right?<sup>[[3]](#footnote3)</sup>

As for the lost bits, it’s going to require some time and effort to restore. I’m not certain I will find it worthwhile to anymore.
