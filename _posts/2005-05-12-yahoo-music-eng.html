<p>Update: Eww, buck-chew-tak stamp. &quot;per Month&quot; i also read as &quot;per Year&quot;. Typo corrected.<br /><br />Sounds like interesting stuff, based on Napster-To-Go model.. but <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/musicengine/">YME</a> is only USD $5 for a <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">YEAR</span> </span>month subscription. How many <a href="http://blog.kordix.com/marv/archives/000400.html">CDs can you rip now</a> [if it comes out of a speaker, it can go into a mic and onto my harddisk]? Sounds like a good deal.<br /><br />Yay, price war! $0.99 a song! $5 a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">year</span> month! $10 for your lifetime, your children's lifetime and their children's lifetime!<br /> <br /></p>
