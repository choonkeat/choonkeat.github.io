<p>Checkout the videos [12mb download]! Very eerie feeling that I can't make out how I feel... they are alive.. and like a millipede that broke off and eww... See for yourself: <a href="http://www.mae.cornell.edu/ccsl/research/selfrep/">Link</a><br /><br />Reminds me of (recently saw the DVD) Aliens Vs Predator's self-configuring pyramid.. <br /><br />But, my 2 cents say &quot;replication&quot; is a misleading word of choice (maybe only to hype things up).. 'cos that made me think it could somehow produced itself out of itself... but maybe that's just me.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
