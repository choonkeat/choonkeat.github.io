<p> <p><a href="http://tailrank.com/">Tailrank</a> is a memetracker, like memeorandum, and it groups related items together in a thread, like Google News. And naturally, threads with more buzz ranks on top.<br /> </p> <p>If it had just stopped there, it would've just been yet-another. However, <a href="http://www.feedblog.org/">Kevin</a> had the smarts to introduce personalisation. What does meme + personalisation give me?<br /> </p> <ul> <li><strong>Meme/clustering</strong>: soften the noise, group related items for me - so I can skim through faster, notice the big (arguably important) news and hence keep in touch with more sources (I'm currently reading ~200 feeds, people like <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Scoble</a> reads over a thousand... !)<br />  </li> <li><strong>Personalised ranking</strong>: the idea of using OPML to help me personalised is quite ingenius. Now I don't have to explicitly tell the system what I like using hard, cold, insensitive keywords like, e.g. rss, ruby, ajax, etc.. I just give the system an OPML file (the defacto representation of a &quot;subscription list&quot;), meaning &quot;<em>here's what I read, show me what is important to me</em>&quot;..&nbsp; akin to Amazon's &quot;<em>here are the books I bought, now recommend me a new book</em>&quot;</li> </ul> <p>Though I like the implicitness of importing OPML to &quot;set&quot; my preferences, the fact that an OPML file has to be used might probably leave out a larger population - if RSS adoption is 4%... OPML is probably... </p> <p>I wonder if there're more straightforward sources could be used to infer... and hence making the service more inclusive? My <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.ici.ous</a> bookmarks? My <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">flickr</a> photos? My homepage? My browser bookmarks? My browser history (oh.. too private)? <br /> </p> <blockquote>&quot;we have... more conveniences, but less time&quot; - <a href="http://www.trans4mind.com/counterpoint/moorehead.shtml">paradox of our age</a>.</blockquote></p>
