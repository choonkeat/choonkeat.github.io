<p>I've been hacked once before. I know what <a href="http://xiaxue.blogspot.com/2005/07/my-blog-got-hacked.html">she means</a>. Feels like shit. Anyone with any way of helping, I'm sure she'd appreciate. <a href="http://xiaxue.blogspot.com/2005/07/i-want-to-catch-culprit.html">Spread the word</a>. I'm not a fan, but that's not a reason not to lift a finger.<br/>

Update: <a href="http://wonkytong.blogspot.com/2005/07/hacked.html">WonkyTong</a> hacked too? This is either :<br />
<ul><br />
<li>a sick meme</li><br />
<li>blogger security hole</li><br />
<li>blogger.sg wireless trap (but wonkytong didn't go right?</li><br />
</ul><br />
Given that there's no related news in the rest of the world.. i think its a geographical thing. Ppl, pls refer to <a href="http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2005/07/xiaxues_email_a.html">mrbrown's cautionary notes for XX's incident</a>. For now, I'm changing my passwords.<br />
<br/>

Somebody just passed me another blogger's URL - and the first thought, '<i>Huh, so-and-so hacked too?</i>'. Damn, today is the only day you'll not want to see your blog listed on mrbrown's.</p>
