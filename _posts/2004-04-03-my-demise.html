<p>Wasn't home yesterday -grin- to write somethin here. Hmm, i should get moblog feature up soon.. and perhaps get a camera phone while i'm at it.. and perhaps change my phone subscription to StarHub too...<br /><br />Anyways, was havin dinner with Love and she gave me a lovers-ultimatum (yet again). This time the test for our Hero was to recognize the tasty, black, ring thingies you see at the frontmost of this plate of left-over pizza<br /><br />

<br />(Sorry folks, forgot to rotate this pic before uploadin.. gotta tilt ur head to the right)<br /><br />Anyways.. silly me went on to guess.. of all things?.... Anchovies?!? How would I know that's fancy angmor for plain-old <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=anchovies">gang-he-kia</a>? All I knew was that I heard <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=michelangelo+turtle">Michaelangelo</a> mentions it a lot :-( Guess I should've learn how to cook then.. <br /><br />And to make matters worse.. a second ultimatum floored our Hero as well! What fruit juice has orangey sourness.. peachy pale color.. How could anyone have guessed grape-fruit? -doh!- ... And that's how &quot;we decided&quot; to embark on our a-fruit-a-week tutorials so that Hero can learn of all the fruity goodies.. <br /><br />Anyways.. hungry now and going off for dinner soon. -Yum yum-</p><p /><p />
