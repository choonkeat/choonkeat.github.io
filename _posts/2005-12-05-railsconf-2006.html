<p>Just when I'd set the date to visit my friend in NYC (postponed thrice!) in Apr.. comes the announcement of <a href="http://www.railsconf.org/">RailsConf</a> in end June '06. I would really prefer visiting US of A at a cooler climate.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> &quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">24 degree celsius. That's Singapore's weather on a good day</span>&quot;, Love quipped<br/>
</div><br />
<br/>
And, flying from <a href="http://rss.farecompare.com/rss/viewResults?departure=NYC&amp;destination=CHI">New York to Chicago</a> would raise my total expenditure by at least SGD $1200.. I'm not exactly feeling too rich at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
From the rate Rails is growing... this is too big to miss... <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com">paypal donations</a> can get me there. Hmm. <br/>

Will be back online nxt week. BBL.<br/></p>
