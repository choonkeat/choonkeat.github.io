<p> I'm so glad I hadn't bought the <a href="http://www.sharperimage.com/us/en/catalog/productview.jhtml?sku=SI727RED">vacuum robot</a> yet... b'cos a new-comer &quot;vacuums, washes and dries in a single pass&quot; (reminds me of how years ago, desktop router prices fell $100 and pack more features a week after I bought mine). Kewl! Checkout <a href="http://www.irobot.com/consumer/scooba_sneak_preview.cfm">Scooba's sneak peak page</a> and the demo (very short) videos.<br /><br />Hmm, what's left? Wash windows, laundry (wash, dry, folder, hang in closet), dust shelves, plates, kitchen (include oily walls).. If things turns out right.. by the time I have to do housework.. I won't have to!<br /><br />Ya, I'm a youngest-child-good-life-spoilt-brat.  (--&quot;)<br /><br /></p>
