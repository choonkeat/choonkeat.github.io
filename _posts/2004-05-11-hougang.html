<p>Love has been debating with me on what Jason Mraz's been mouthing in a very popular song recently, <a href="http://www.jasonmraz.com/Lyrics/YouAndIBoth.html">You &amp; I Both</a>. It was until this afternoon that we'd settled it once and for all, with the help of my <a href="http://www.google.com/">bestest friend</a>. I still can't believe he could sing &quot;What you and I spoke of&quot; in 2-syllabus?! Or what seems like 2 syllabus to me.. it certainly sounded like he was saying &quot;You and I both Loved.. Hougang.. &quot;. </p><p>Love says I'm crazy and deaf. Dear SG, listen to the song (the next time) and tell me if I'm entirely off.</p><p>Btw, got myself a moblog (wee!) though its not a DIY and neither is it integrated into this blog.. at least that's something!<br /></p>
