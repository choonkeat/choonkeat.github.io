<p>A small, agile Singapore-based company that I know of has just started using <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> to manage 2 of their latest, biggest projects. Their technical lead is also checking out Ruby and more importantly, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. This is a company doing their projects with <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2005/06/14/wrong-fight">Java on LAMP</a>. Perfect fit.<br/>
<br/>
I know pockets of companies has been <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hiring+rails+developers">picking up Rails developers</a>.. But this has been of the closest proximity thus far (not they're not hiring Rails developers, yet). But its right here. An actual company. I am not alone.<br/>
<br/>
I'm <span style="font-weight: bold;">really</span> holding my breath for things to work out... <br/></p>
