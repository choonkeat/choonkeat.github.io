<p>Finally thought of something to do for Railsday this Saturday!! :-D For the uninformed, Railsday is a day where teams(1 to 3) participate in a 24-hour hackathon to come up with some kewl Rails apps - checkout the <a href="http://railsday.com/prizes">drool worthy prizes</a>! But I'd like to add, very straight-faced, that the greatest prize will be the opportunity to learn more Rails in 24 hours - more efficient than any self-disciplined project will give.</p><p>Since there are plenty more coders out there more familiar with this young framework (me the newbie am learning <strong>so much</strong> just by looking at <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/">Typo blog</a> source code, so you know where I stand) I bet I can't win on "<a href="http://railsday.com/rules">Completeness, Code quality and UI</a>" so I'll be hoping for the other areas like creativity and usefulness. Sadly colleagues whom have heard my idea says I'm delusionally excited. *pooh*</p><p>Nevertheless, I've gotten my hands on the latest (only) <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/">Rails Bible</a> hoping it'll ward off all evils. Smart guys these publishers.. Railsday coming up and they release their "beta e-book" for sale - so I'm suckered. But its good, 50 pages of selected reading and I think I can cut out 1/3 of my code in <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/">Rssfwd</a>.</p><p>And honestly, if I were back, working in small independent software houses, creating web applications and hosting (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_service_provider">ASP model</a>) for clients (e.g. ex-companies).. I'll definitely push to use Rails. </p><p>Because I'd want to be able to have dinner at home more often.</p>
