One is &quot;what's that geeky you?&quot;; The other is &quot;hmmmm.. ?&quot; with a smile forming at the corner of the mouth.. Yes, for those 2nd types.. Gmail handles the irky <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=winmail.dat">winmail.dat</a> attachment for you - it just works. For those first types.. you've been causing way too much dismay to those 2nd types.. now go apologise to anyone you notice to be smiling more these days..<br /><br />Oops.. today only got 1.. back to work!<br /><br /></p>
