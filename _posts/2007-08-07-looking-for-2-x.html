<p>Since my job posting is mysteriously not appearing on joelonsoftware job board, I thought I might as well post them here. So if you know of anyone who might be interested in this, please forward this entry to them - thanks lots!</p>

<p><strong>1. Affle</strong></p>

<p>What does Affle do? <strong>MY</strong> description would be: The current flagship product, SMS2, is <em>basically Adsense for SMS - but mostly content (rss, headlines, e.g.) instead of ads.</em> i.e. relevant, non-intrusive. You can read in more detail <a href="http://sms2.sg/">here</a>. </p>

<p>Care deeply about algorithms, protocols, huge data sets, web2.0, user experience or Friday pizza? Then you'll be in good company. Apply <a href="http://www.affle.co.uk/jobs/join-us/join-us.html">here</a>. The tech hq is <a href="http://www.streetdirectory.com/asia_travel/travel/travel_id_138/travel_site_3096/">here</a> in Singapore.</p>

<p><strong>2. SharedCopy</strong></p>

<p>What was once <a href="http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2007/03/as-easy-as-pass.html">a proof of concept</a> is now <a href="http://sharedcopy.com/">my fulltime project</a> - how's that for work and play? <a href="http://flash.screeniac.com/sharedcopy/sharedcopy.html?TB_iframe=true&amp;height=590&amp;width=1050">This nifty little tool</a> let's anyone with a browser to write on any webpage - and share it easily. </p>

<p>Young project with lots of ideas to explore and expand. If this gets your coding fingers dancing already, drop me an email - choonkeat at gmail.com - this project needs you!</p>
