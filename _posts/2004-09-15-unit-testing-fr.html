<p>I guess JUnit (or <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span>Unit) can learn a thing or two from <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=7776">ZenTest</a> - guiding the programmer to unit test. <br /><br />Having a good unit test framework ain't enough. If the lazy coder ain't picking up 'a new skill'.. he ain't ever going to write that unit test - properly. ZenTest doesn't stop there. It <span style="font-weight: bold;">works with the programmer's existing code</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">guides</span> the programmer to <span style="font-weight: bold;">build up</span> the unit tests.<br /><br />That's what a good framework should be aye? Not to stop at the libraries.. but find ways to gel into the user's (user of the framework) workflow. Same goes for application framework / platform / middleware. If it only stops at the technical prowers and available, passive libraries without taking the step to conjure a 'best-practice use' of itself.. then it will only be as good as a dustbin touting &quot;Please Use Me&quot;.. as compared to a recycle bin with a &quot;Throw Aluminium Cans Here&quot; sign.<br /><br /><br /></p>
