<p><a href="http://www.entrepreneur27.org/sg/?p=22">E27</a> turned out quite well :-) though lengthy Q&amp;As could've been better controlled with some Oscar music and <em>ushered to be </em><em>continued</em><em> in the corridors</em>. Or maybe its just me being the last presenter! </p><p>Thanks <a href="http://www.justinlee.name/">Justin</a> &amp; <a href="http://bjornlee.wordpress.com/">Bjorn</a> for organising this event! Sorry I had to swap in with a laptop, as my Nokia thumbdrive died on me (remind self: never use storage device from handphone maker and <a href="../../articles/2005/01/28/old-is-better-new-is-just-more">never use handphone from a refrigerator maker</a>) <br /></p><p>The yet-to-be-formed singapore.rb was there as well. We had actually piggy backed on this event for a brief gathering. Though only 3 of us were there (4 I think? But we didn't get to connect), it was sure nice to see fellow Railers in the same room (Hi Doug &amp; Billy)... perhaps a good prep for <a href="http://www.railsconf.org/">the big one</a> tmrw.</p><p>Oh well, *yawn* looks like I gotta sleep before the flight after all...&nbsp;</p>
