title: Better incoming email handling for your webapp
published: true
---
<p>A standard feature in a webapp is to send emails to an end user. This can be done by</p>

<ul>
<li>using the locally installed <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">mail transfer agent (MTA) like postfix</a> (not available on heroku)</li>
<li>paying a bit of money and using SendGrid</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/andris9/directmail">sending directly to the recipient smtp server</a> (doesn&#8217;t work well if you are on ec2)</li>
</ul>


<p>What happens when your user replies to that email, using email? You could stonewall with a non-existant <code>donotreply@example.com</code>&#8230; but how about when you <em>do</em> want to handle a reply? Add a link in the email saying <code>click here to reply using our web interface</code>? I find that UX onerous and usually terribly slow e.g. working through my inbox during commute.</p>

<p>A better UX would be to allow an actual email reply.</p>

<h3>Incoming email</h3>

<p>Handling incoming emails might seem like dark waters for web developers. Many solutions offered on stackoverflow &amp; mailing lists usually involves gmail, imap and polling.</p>

<p>Polling. Ugh.</p>

<h3>Event driven incoming email</h3>

<p>A better way is to pipe incoming email directly to your application for processing. And for web developers, &#8220;pipe&#8221; preferably means a <code>HTTP POST</code> into your favourite web framework. aka a Webhook.</p>

<p>A quick overview of such setup is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Point <code>MX</code> dns entry for your domain to the server that can receive email (e.g. ubuntu with postfix installed); this server <em>can</em> be a different server from your webapp</li>
<li>Configure <code>postfix</code> to handle that email with an <a href="https://gist.github.com/choonkeat/3225691">smtp-to-http shell script</a></li>
<li>Now every incoming email is just a regular HTTP form post to your webapp. Throw the blob of email content into a parser like <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/mail">mail</a> or <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/mailparser">mailparser</a> and you&#8217;d have a handy email object to manipulate.</li>
</ol>


<p>Configuring your own <code>Postfix</code> server and installing that script to work with <code>Postfix</code> might be difficult to some, walk in the park for others, but definitely a hairy piece of infrastructure to keep around. You can make things less hairy by paying a SaaS provider to take care of #1 and #2, but there are caveats.</p>

<h3>Reply-To as Identifier</h3>

<p>Most webapps I see uses a custom <code>Reply-To</code> email address (e.g. Basecamp &amp; Github) In this design, an email notification sent from Discussion <code>id=42</code> would use <code>Reply-To: discussion-42@webapp.com</code>; an email notification for Discussion <code>id=99</code> would use a different <code>Reply-To: discussion-99@webapp.com</code> address.</p>

<p>When a user replies via email, the webhook handler parses <code>To: discussion-42@webapp.com</code> header, retrieves <code>Dicussion.find(42)</code> and create a new discussion comment on behalf of <code>User.where(email: email.from)</code>, using the email html/text body as <code>comment.body</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, unless you pay <a href="www.cloudmailin.com/plans">an arm and a leg</a>, you&#8217;ll only get 1x email address to use as your <code>Reply-To</code>. Also, any attachment in the email would be lost.</p>

<p>So having unique-per-conversation <code>Reply-To</code> address is inefficient &amp; restrictive your infrastructure options.</p>

<h3>Discussion Thread</h3>

<p>One more thing.</p>

<p>Unless you want your webapp&#8217;s email messages to reach your user&#8217;s inbox as individual, annoyingly unrelated messages, your job is actually not done yet.</p>

<p>A conversation in your webapp should ideally be threaded in the same manner in your user&#8217;s inbox (e.g. see Basecamp discussions &amp; Github Issues). So when <code>userX</code> comments on <code>Discussion 42</code>, the outgoing email notification sent to other participants of the discussion should properly set <code>In-Reply-To: &lt;discussion42messageid&gt;</code> and <code>References: &lt;discussion42messageid&gt;</code> in order for them to thread properly in Gmail, Apple Mail and presumably anything else. Having a matching mail subject is essential too, but that&#8217;s the easy part.</p>

<p>By now we&#8217;d have a module to manage mapping of <code>Discussion</code> records to-and-fro <code>Reply-To</code> values. And another module to manage a consistent value of <code>Message-Id</code>, <code>In-Reply-To</code> and <code>References</code> for <code>Discussion</code> records.</p>

<p>Seems unnecessarily complicated.</p>

<h3>Message-Id as Identifier (duh)</h3>

<p>We can simplify the design by giving up unique-per-conversation <code>Reply-To</code>.</p>

<p>Uh? Then how do you know if an email replied <code>To: standard@webapp.com</code> is for <code>Dicussion.find(42)</code>? We look inside the values array of <code>In-Reply-To</code> + <code>References</code> instead.</p>

<p>For example, an outgoing email from your webapp just need to craft the correct, unique-per-conversation <code>Message-Id: &lt;discussion-42@webapp.com&gt;</code>. A email reply to that will automatically contain these headers</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>In-Reply-To: &lt;discussion-42@webapp.com&gt;
</span><span class='line'>References: &lt;discussion-42@webapp.com&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And our webhook handler can still locate Discussion 42 based on values array of <code>In-Reply-To</code> + <code>References</code>. Thus, managing <code>Message-Id</code> alone will suffice.</p>

<p>Warning: earlier we mentioned using <code>email.from</code> to identify the <code>User</code>, but that&#8217;s not reliable since email <code>From:</code> header can be easily faked. A better mechanism would be to embed the author identity in <code>References</code></p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>A quick summary of this scheme is</p>

<ol>
<li>User#1 create new Discussion#42 with User#2 as participant</li>
<li>App delivers &#8216;new discussion&#8217; email to User#2 with <code>Message-Id: &lt;D42&gt;</code> and <code>References: &lt;D42-U2SECRET&gt;</code></li>
<li>User#2 replies to email, email automatically carries <code>In-Reply-To: &lt;D42&gt;</code> and <code>References: &lt;D42&gt; &lt;D42-U2SECRET&gt;</code></li>
<li>Webhook handler picks up <code>D42</code> to retrieve Discussion#42, and picks up <code>U2SECRET</code> to locate User#2 and proceed to create a comment</li>
<li>App delivers &#8216;new comment&#8217; email to User#1 with <code>References: &lt;D42&gt; &lt;D42-U1SECRET&gt;</code> (notice <code>Message-Id</code> doesn&#8217;t matter from here onwards)</li>
</ol>


<h3>Diymailin</h3>

<p>That could be the end of the story for most people, but for <a href="https://github.com/develsadvocates/runtimeerror.js">various reasons</a> I couldn&#8217;t afford to have an unreasonably low cap on the number of incoming emails, and have attachments stripped.</p>

<p>So for my own setup, I pay $5/month for a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=8d52e959ad0f">Digital Ocean</a> box to run a <a href="https://github.com/choonkeat/diymailin">diymailin</a> instance. With that I can support the numerous apps that I have using diymailin&#8217;s built in web interface, without mucking around with arcane <code>postfix</code> config.</p>

<h3>Mail2Webhook</h3>

<p>But if you&#8217;re too lazy to setup your own diymailin instance, you can hop on to <a href="https://www.mail2webhook.com/">mail2webhook.com</a> and use my setup instead.</p>
