<p>Haha. The last time a virus was entertaining was probably the early 90s with <a href="http://www.phreak.org/archives/The_Hacker_Chronicles_II/virusl5/virusl5.20">Pacman viruses (or &quot;You have been Stoned!&quot;)</a>. Now we just get boring email spams and no <span style="font-style: italic;">fun</span> factor. I guess the motivation is different.<br/>
<br/>
So now, forget <a href="http://jotlive.com/">Jotlive</a>, or <a href="http://www.writely.com/">Writely</a>.. this must be the fun-est Ajax usage: <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-10-13-n73.html">How to Make 1 Million Friends on MySpace</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote> someone by the name of Samy wrote a social network popularity worm... and made over a million new friends, all of whom now had the text &ldquo;but most of all, samy is my hero&rdquo; in their self-description.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Here's the <a href="http://namb.la/popular/tech.html">How</a>, the <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-10-14-n81.html">Interview</a>, and ... of cos where's the fun without <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/products/product/product.asp?general%5Fcategory%5Fid=103001500200055451&amp;caching=on&amp;product%5Fid=235675854368861575&amp;index=1">&quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">Samy is My Hero</span>&quot; T-shirts</a>? Funny people :-)<br/>
<br/>
Only one <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">nitpick</span> question I have on the whole scenario though.. if Samy wished to stop the virus.. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote> &quot;I absolutely wanted to stop it. Deleting my account wouldn&rsquo;t stop propagation at all, but I tried that anyway.&quot;</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Why can't he modify his original script on his profile, and <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2004/07/08/patch-process">spread a virus-removal virus</a>?<br/></p>
