<p>Blogger Wuming_Gong reports that <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/wgong/Blog/cns!47B353A64E7FC0B4!132.entry">RssFwd is inaccessible</a> from within the Great Firewall of China. Its the equivalence of finding your proprietary software cracked on <a href="http://astalavista.box.sk/">Astalavista</a> - a <em>good</em> problem indicating your software has arrived.<br /></p>
