<p>After putting up <a href="http://jobs.37signals.com/jobs/2749">a job post for SharedCopy</a> at the 37signals job board, I've gotten quite a fair bit of response and in turn, had to propose timings for Skype calls very often.</p>

<p>I hate timezones.</p>

<p>For my purpose (i.e. propose a time where all parties are at least awake!) I figure I'd just need a simple view of everybody's clock over a period of 1 day - which can be done in Ruby:<br /> </p><blockquote><p>24.times do |hh|<br />&nbsp; puts [+8, -7, -5].collect {|tz| Time.now.utc + hh + (tz * 3600) }.inspect<br />end</p></blockquote><p>Functional, but a chore to run and the output is still a mess to pick out information from. Then I did a proper one in Javascript, in case I ever need to use it while on the move... ;-) </p>

<p>[Update] A few notes:</p>

<ul><li>The darker/<strong>shaded areas are ZZZ hours</strong> - so just look for horizontals where the &quot;whites&quot; align.</li>

<li>Your own timezone should automatically show up - so <strong>most usage is only 1 click</strong>.</li>

<li>URL changes as you add timezones - so you <strong>can even bookmark the page</strong> and remember a standard set of timezones.</li>

<li>Day-of-week is subtly indicated just so <strong>you can tell if its the same day or otherwise</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Name of location</strong> is used instead of numeric offset (and <strong>auto resized to fit</strong>) for a more humane experience</li></ul>
