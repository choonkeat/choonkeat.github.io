<p>SharedCopy was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/10/bookmark-copy-note-and-share-sharedcopycom">Techcrunched</a> a few hours ago. A more positive milestone than <a href="../../articles/2006/04/03/rssfwd-blocked-in-china">the previous one</a> to say the least! </p><p>I'm very thrilled and will blog a bit more laters. Haven't been a good blogger lately, only have been making commentaries over here: <a href="http://sharedcopy.com/public/users/choonkeat">http://sharedcopy.com/public/users/choonkeat</a><br /></p><p>Wouldn't it be awesome to <a href="http://sharedcopy.com/public/api">integrate</a> that with blogging platforms?</p>
