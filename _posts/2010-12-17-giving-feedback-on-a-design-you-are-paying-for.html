<p>I find it hard to comprehend why anyone paying good money for design, would review in this manner. Over and over, round after round. Sounds more like a person trying to work Photoshop with voice control. Shouldn&#8217;t we let the skilled worry about their craft? If your designer doesn&#8217;t know design better than you, why there is a business relationship?</p>

<p>On the back of such encounters (as an onlooker), I had concluded [mistakenly] that having multiple rounds of design reviews was just masturbatory and that a customer should only focus to communicate the whys clearly and leave designers to do their job.</p>

<p>Yesterday, 37signals posted <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=behind+the+scenes+site:37signals.com">another</a> &#8220;Behind the scenes&#8221; <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2705-behind-the-scenes-37signalscom-redesign">article on their blog</a>. As I was reading their recap of multiple iterations and feedback, it occurred to me that my conclusion was misdirected. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the fact that there were multiple rounds of review. My issue was with the nature of the critiques.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2705-behind-the-scenes-37signalscom-redesign">feedback for each round</a> were about story, intent, clarity. Not pixel pushing. Seems to me, <em>that</em> is how a money paying customer should be reviewing to get his money&#8217;s worth.<br />
