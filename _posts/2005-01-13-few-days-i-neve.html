<p>Of cos I'd like to think my listener-ship mattered that much. Just a few days I never tune in then <a href="http://class95.mediacorpradio.com/classmdt.htm">Morning Express</a> (arguably <a href="http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/1997/09/sne_part_1.html">the best morning radio show in Singapore</a>) closing shop liao? If you're a believer in petitions, perhaps <a href="http://thiscause.org/p/menu.php?p=Too85949DB">this can help</a>.<br /><br /><br /></p>
