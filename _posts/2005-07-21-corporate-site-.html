<p>Go to a company's website. Go to &quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">management</span>&quot; or &quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">about us</span>&quot;. What do you get? Boring stuff, men and women in suits smiling blah.. and as <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/">Textdrive</a> would say:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>We have no photographs of our CEO strutting past server racks, or of women in telephone headsets ready to take your call, but we hope you&rsquo;ll consider joining us all the same.<br/>
</blockquote> <br/>
Go see Activegrid's: <a href="http://www.activegrid.com/company/management2.php">Management Team page</a>. I couldn't stop laughing :-D (from <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/07/20/activegrid-first-impressions/">lesscode.org</a>). What does your company website say about you?<br/></p>
