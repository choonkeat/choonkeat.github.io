<p>Anyone knows how <a href="http://cbl.abuseat.org/">CBL</a> works? Its funny they provide so much information on their site, but nothing concrete. Perhaps they should just tell me <strong>WHY</strong> an ip address is listed <strong>BEFORE</strong> presenting their reels of text educating what you must, must not, need, need not, could, could not, am, am not, doing, done, did not,... watever!</p><p>I mean since its not about spam or open relays, ip addresses listed on CBL probably has no intention to be on it (read: victim). So what's with the secrecy?</p><p>Apologies to some RssFwd users whom are not receiving their daily feeds. Most probably your mail server is rejecting: <br /></p><blockquote>550-Message rejected because <a target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://yanime.at.spry.com/">yanime.at.spry.com</a> [<a target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://66.249.1.208/">66.249.1.208</a>] is<br />550-blacklisted at <a target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://cbl.abuseat.org/"><span class="st0">cbl</span>.<span class="st0">abuseat</span>.<span class="st0">org</span></a> see Blocked - see<br />550 <a target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://cbl.abuseat.org/lookup.cgi?ip=66.249.1.208">http://<span class="st0">cbl</span>.<span class="st0">abuseat</span>.<span class="st0">org</span>/lookup.cgi?ip=66.249.1.208</a></blockquote><p>Any enlightenment is appreciated.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;IMHO CBL.abuseat.org is not fit for use without whitelisting some IP addresses in most installations.&quot;<br />- <a href="http://www.issociate.de/board/post/252976/How_good_is_cbl.abuseat.org?.html">How good is cbl.abuseat.org?</a><br />&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
