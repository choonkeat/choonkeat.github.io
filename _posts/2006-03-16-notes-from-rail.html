<p><a href="http://www.writely.com/View.aspx?docid=bdcqxwhdqrc96">Here is the notes and patch</a> (urgh!) to the Ruby on Rails Bootcamp I'd presented on Tuesday. But generally, it was more about flowing with the code, so the notes themselves may not make sense as stand-alone.<br /> </p><p>A better arrangement should've been 2 sessions - easier on the brain, especially from the culture shock for most Java developers - of 2.5 hours each. That should be enough to cover topics plus have enough hands-on.<br /> </p>
