<p>Nice interface - it looks vaguely familiar actually. I wonder if <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/11/coghead-goes-live-build-applications-visually/">Coghead</a> intend to woo the enterprise crowd and do a <em>Save-as BPEL</em> ;-)<br /></p><p>If a developer using a Coghead application can switch (with a click on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a>, and authentication) into inspect/debugging mode on the current application's current page that could be swell.</p>
