<p> <p>Sorry <a href="http://uzyn.com/2006/06/28/my-15-mins/">U-Zyn</a>, but after trying out the feeds, I've unsubscribed. Nothing wrong with them, no hard feelings, but I'd just like to mention why: </p> <blockquote>The links don't bring me to the original article.</blockquote><p>I know its probably (haven't tried) not your fault because the lousy data from todayonline doesn't contain the URL in the first place. And I can also hear &quot;<span style="font-style: italic">since the full content is there already, why need a link to the content?</span>&quot;. </p><p>I guess I'm just one of the wierder 0.1% out of the 4% of people who is RSS-aware. But over time, I've tuned my reading process to what helps keep me sane, tracking the few hundred feeds that I'm subscribed to: </p><ol> <li>Skims RSS articles from oldest to latest (to have context)</li> <li>Interesting articles gets ctrl-clicked (Firefox opens them in a background tab)</li> <li>Repeat #1 and #2 until the tabs looks too uncomfortable squeezing next to each other</li> <li>Start reading the tabs and closing them as I go</li> <li>Repeat from #1.</li> </ol><p><br /> So, if step #2 doesn't happen its a no go for me.</p><p>Hmm, probably you could publish those articles on your own server with their own URL. But then again, there's this copyright thing.<br /></p></p>
