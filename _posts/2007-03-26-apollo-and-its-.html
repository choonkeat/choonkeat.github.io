<p>In case you've been living under a rock (<em>like me with over 1k unread feed items</em>), the recent buzz in Web tech has been around <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/videos/apollo_demo07/index.html">Adobe's Apollo runtime platform</a>, and <a href="http://joyeur.com/2007/03/22/joyent-slingshot">Joyent's Slingshot</a>. Now that I've watched both videos, and read Joyent's own post (instead of 3rd party reporting), I'm very pleased to observe the first steps towards <a href="http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2005/12/browser-based-a.html">realisation of vision</a> (more with regards to Slingshot):</p>

<p>A Rails VM! That comes complete with its own browser and desktop events (e.g. drag-drop). What a clever, clean way of doing Browser-Based Application! Kudos to the pretty package. Crossing my fingers that it'll live up to its expectation, and that <em>client installation of Slingshot is totally seamless</em>.<br /> </p> <p>If the consistency in Rails directory layout and library arrangement can breed Slingshot et al... I can't wait to see what Rails RESTfulness will lead to. </p>
