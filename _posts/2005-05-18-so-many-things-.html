<p>Arghhh!! 1 week after launch of Backpack, they released <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/37signals/beMH?m=333">Backpack mobile</a>.. 2nd week (now) its <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/api/">APIs</a>! Now I reaaaaally have to find time play with my backpack account. Dammit! Checkout <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/05/new_way_of_doin.html">rael's ideas on mixing Backpack with Amazon</a>.. <br /><br />And then, there's PS3 [checkout the <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3140617">video</a>].. there's <a href="http://tomorrow.sg/archives/2005/05/17/radio-controlled_car_drift.html">kewl kewl RC cars</a> (btw, these SG Drifters can <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/05/rc_cars_on_the.html">help SAF</a> ya know?).. and <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/17/star_wars_last_suppe.html">Star Wars</a>.. and I gotta blog about <a href="http://nana.yanime.org/blog/2">Love</a>... and I'm running out of <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/">server diskspace</a>... <br /><br />I think there's some secret conspiracy to make so many things happen on my birthday week so as to discourage me in getting out of my room to celebrate. Grrrr! <br /><br />PS: Caught any hints yet?<br /><br /></p>
