<p> <p>In case some of you have not been following, and are still holding &quot;<em>J2EE vs .NET</em>&quot;, or &quot;<em>Java vs .Net</em>&quot; debates... there's a substitute going on inside the ring. Its now becoming a more inclusive JVM vs .NET. </p> <p>And this time, the <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/09/jruby-steps-into-sun.html">casts</a> <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython">promises</a> to be much more <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060810-7462.html">interesting</a>.</p> <p>Heck, everything's going on virtual! Soon you'll be typing on that virtual keyboard on your Intel box that boots up a virtual operating system image to visit your virtual online store that is written in JScheme running on top of the Java virtual machine. But maybe then, <em>virtual</em> and <em>online</em> becomes default enough that we stop prefixing nouns with it.<br /> </p></p>
