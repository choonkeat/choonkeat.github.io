Back when iPod shuffle was released, other than cynical _5-year-old technology_ remarks, fans have sworn that their shuffle was psychic and would play music according that would be [_just right_ for the moment](http://blog.blankbaby.com/blankbaby/2004/08/the_ipod_has_a_.html)..

Of cos, Apple [insists its just random](http://www.macobserver.com/article/2004/08/26.2.shtml).

I've figured out the how-to. It is actually relatively easy and arguably accurate. The only question is, how much would a consumer (read: you) pay for such a feature?
