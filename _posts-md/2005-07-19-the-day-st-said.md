Maybe printed press should get training on [TinyURL](http://tinyurl.com/). Hence, the problematic bigf\*\*\*.blogspot.com can be printed as [**http://tinyurl.com/7ns3v**](http://tinyurl.com/7ns3v) and rockson's will become [**http://tinyurl.com/8e4bn**](http://tinyurl.com/8e4bn). See? Looks so innocent, saves ink, and information remains correct. Much better than censoring with stupid asterisks.
