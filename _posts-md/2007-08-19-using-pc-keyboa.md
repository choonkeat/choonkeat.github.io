title: Using PC keyboard on MacBook Pro (aka swapping Cmd and Option keys)

Found [this script](http://www.macgeekery.com/development/gui_automation_with_applescript) today that switches the Command and Option key on my Mac - especially useful when I plugin my PC keyboard to my MBP and need the LEFT-ALT key to act as "Command", and WIN key as "Option".

The script on the article won't work off the bat if you just copy-and-paste, try copying from this instead: [http://pastie.caboo.se/89067](http://pastie.caboo.se/89067)
