I am so close to switching from Eclipse to Netbeans6 now - the JRuby powered IDE environment is really terrific. Just one missing thing: **(Ctrl-Shift-R) Open Resource**

 

What it does in Eclipse (IntelliJ also spots this feature) is basically to find and open any file, anywhere in the your workspace without navigating the folder tree - simply type, and a real-time search of the file names will be done. The sorted order respects proximity of projects and etc. "\*" matching will work as expected.

 Can't live without _that_.
