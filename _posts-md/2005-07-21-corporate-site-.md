Go to a company's website. Go to "management" or "about us". What do you get? Boring stuff, men and women in suits smiling blah.. and as [Textdrive](http://www.textdrive.com/) would say:

> We have no photographs of our CEO strutting past server racks, or of women in telephone headsets ready to take your call, but we hope youâ€™ll consider joining us all the same.

   
Go see Activegrid's: [Management Team page](http://www.activegrid.com/company/management2.php). I couldn't stop laughing :-D (from [lesscode.org](http://lesscode.org/2005/07/20/activegrid-first-impressions/)). What does your company website say about you?
