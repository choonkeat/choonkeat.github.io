I'm glad to announce that [RssFwd](http://www.rssfwd.com/)'s hosting will henceforth be sponsored by [Sproutit.com](http://www.sproutit.com/) [see [story](http://www.sproutit.com/story)]  
  
To pacify the most important question: Yes, RssFwd will continue to be free. Hey, its an [open source software](http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/developers) ya know?  
  
What's so hi-tech and advanced about RssFwd? Nothing! [Charles Jolley](http://www.okito.net/about) and gang appreciates RssFwd precisely for its nothingness - what it doesn't do and the little it already does - no [lock-in](http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2005/08/18/export-or-manage-your-rssfwd-subscriptions), no [lock-out](http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/import), no user accounts and frivolous login/passwords to remember, it is simple and [out of your way](http://www.37signals.com/presentations/sxsw2005/37s-bigthingssmallteam.pdf#page=16) [pdf, recommended reading]  
  
Go read the official [announcement](http://www.sproutit.com/bigact/2005/09/07/sproutit-com-sponsoring-rssfwd)! It can only get better!  
  
PS: Yes, I can really [mark "open source project" as Done](http://www.43things.com/person/choonkeat).
