My crazy school mate has really embarked on [his cycling trip from Arctic back to Singapore](http://www.sgblog.com/a2e/mt/)! Crazy, but nonetheless, simply inspirational!! Who says [Khoo Swee Chiow](http://www.everestnews.com/swee.htm)'s the only gungho adventurer from SG?  
  
And omigod.. checkout their route! What better advertisement for [Shimano](http://www.shimano.com/) [than this](http://www.sgblog.com/a2e/mt/archives/2004/10/tech_talk_5000k.html)?  
  
Excerpts:

  
"Modern industrialized states [are] resentful of a few cleverly arranged pounds of tubes and spokes. The cyclist creates everything from almost nothing, becoming the most energy-efficient of all moving animals and machines and as such, has a disingenuous ability to challenge the entire value system of a society. Cyclists don't consume enough. They can propel themselves 1500 pollution-free miles on the energy equivalent of a gallon of petrol. The bicycle may be too cheap, too available, too healthy, too independent and too equitable for its own good. In an age of excess it is minimal and has the subversive potential to make people happy in an economy fuelled by consumer discontent." -Jim McGurn, 1994
