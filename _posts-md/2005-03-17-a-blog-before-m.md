Angsty piece.. apparently aggregated many episodes in 1 entry.. tsk tsk. Hey [bro](http://cheekybynature.blogspot.com/2005/03/encounter-with-african-player.html), I'd never realised there's so many expressways in Singapore..

  
I have been assigned to work at Tuas recently. Sorry, not just Tuas. In fact, it is Tuas SOUTH. KNN, Tuas South is one f\*cking ulu place. I have to drive thru six expressways (TPE, SLE, BKE, KJE, PIE, AYE) to get there, and it is taking me one f\*cking hour to reach my work place. And I have to do this for 2 man-months, which is 40 working days! Pui!

To defeat life's little annoyances, perhaps you can try the tricks in [this NY Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/15/nyregion/15annoyances.html?ex=1268542800&en=5a77805b2fcc1e66&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland).  
  
PS: Congrats for ya wedding, Alex - so sorry I screwed up my schedule. I'm trying to [get better](http://www.basecamphq.com).
