I'm so glad I hadn't bought the [vacuum robot](http://www.sharperimage.com/us/en/catalog/productview.jhtml?sku=SI727RED) yet... b'cos a new-comer "vacuums, washes and dries in a single pass" (reminds me of how years ago, desktop router prices fell $100 and pack more features a week after I bought mine). Kewl! Checkout [Scooba's sneak peak page](http://www.irobot.com/consumer/scooba_sneak_preview.cfm) and the demo (very short) videos.  
  
Hmm, what's left? Wash windows, laundry (wash, dry, folder, hang in closet), dust shelves, plates, kitchen (include oily walls).. If things turns out right.. by the time I have to do housework.. I won't have to!  
  
Ya, I'm a youngest-child-good-life-spoilt-brat. (--")
