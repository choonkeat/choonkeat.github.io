Nope, the title ain't a spoof of what my ex-colleague ah-lian (no offence!) used to do, stepping into office with her arms sprayed like a blooming flower exclaiming in a chirpy tune, "Its Mmmondayyyyyy!"  
  
Its the [hype](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/12/12.html#a8865) a MS blogger has been [harping on](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/12/11.html#a8853) for the past few days: Microsoft's reply to [Google Desktop Search](http://desktop.google.com/screenshots.html).
