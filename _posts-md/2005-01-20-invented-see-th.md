Well, the next time you walking-walking, feel some numbness and your handphone stop working.. somebody has probably saw you nude. Incredibulously, the crazy guy who invented the [impervious-to-Grizzly-bear suit](http://www.nfb.ca/grizzly/troy.html) (I'd actually saw him on Ripley's Believe or Not) had invented the [Angel Light](http://www.baytoday.ca/content/news/details.asp?c=6657). Whee-u-wheet!

  
"... just a dream, and I saw it, saw the whole casing and everything, and I saw what it could do.. I had the same dream about that three times and by the third time I had it in my head and I started to build it.."  

  
Sigh, ppl who rarely (remembers their) dream (like me) don't get to invent X-ray eyes.. Damn!
