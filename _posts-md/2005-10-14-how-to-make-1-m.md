Haha. The last time a virus was entertaining was probably the early 90s with [Pacman viruses (or "You have been Stoned!")](http://www.phreak.org/archives/The_Hacker_Chronicles_II/virusl5/virusl5.20). Now we just get boring email spams and no fun factor. I guess the motivation is different.  
  
So now, forget [Jotlive](http://jotlive.com/), or [Writely](http://www.writely.com/).. this must be the fun-est Ajax usage: [How to Make 1 Million Friends on MySpace](http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-10-13-n73.html).

> someone by the name of Samy wrote a social network popularity worm... and made over a million new friends, all of whom now had the text “but most of all, samy is my hero” in their self-description.

  
  
Here's the [How](http://namb.la/popular/tech.html), the [Interview](http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-10-14-n81.html), and ... of cos where's the fun without ["Samy is My Hero" T-shirts](http://www.zazzle.com/products/product/product.asp?general%5Fcategory%5Fid=103001500200055451&caching=on&product%5Fid=235675854368861575&index=1)? Funny people :-)  
  
Only one nitpick question I have on the whole scenario though.. if Samy wished to stop the virus..   
  

> "I absolutely wanted to stop it. Deleting my account wouldn’t stop propagation at all, but I tried that anyway."

  
  
Why can't he modify his original script on his profile, and [spread a virus-removal virus](http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2004/07/08/patch-process)?
