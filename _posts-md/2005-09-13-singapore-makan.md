Now that [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/) is showing Singapore nicely.. I've marked a few good eating spots I frequent :-)   
  
  
  
[Download this KMZ file](http://blog.yanime.org/singapore/Singapore_Makan_Places.kmz), double click and open with your installed Google Earth.. and you can see the locations "Singapore Makan Places" :-)   
  
**Update:** Don't just download, follow the [flash demo](http://blog.yanime.org/singapore/singapore_makan_places.html) instead... Sorry!  
  
  
  
Please feel free to update, and send me back more locations! Always love a good meal. Maybe there should be more details like actual address.. open hours.. anyways! Share with me yah? There's got to be more...
