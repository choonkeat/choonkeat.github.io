After many **many** iterations, and with the help of [Divya](http://nimbupani.com/), I've finally pushed out [the redesigned SharedCopy website](http://sharedcopy.com/). New logo, new color scheme, new icons. New.

The biggest change, for me, is the comments. Compare the old listing:

With the new:

Not just a change in look, but the amount of information is also different. The threaded relationship of conversations are visually represented now. A full fledged "comments section" for any web page.

It used to be that SharedCopy is about keeping a copy of a web page - and placing annotations on top. But its become quite clear now, that there's something else as important (if not more so). To paraphrase a famous saying,

> "_Its the comments, stupid_"

Let's see where this realisation takes me.

I'll leave you with a whirlwind tour of the revamped application (1 minute only!). A little video clip I did with my Macintosh:

<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="320" data="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=296938&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=CC0500CC0500">	<param name="quality" value="best">	<param name="allowfullscreen" value="true">	<param name="scale" value="showAll">	<param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=296938&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=CC0500CC0500"></object>
