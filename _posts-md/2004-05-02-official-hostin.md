Today, Yanime officially founded its real hosting, including its very own domain name. Well, its a good start... Spry says I'm allowed to run almost any, even IRC, servers on this baby.. so my TODO list will broadly be:

1. Setup running chat server.  
2. Develop bots and sample implementation to deploy on Yanime's own website.  
3. Get CVS ready (or should just use [SourceForge](http://www.sourceforge.net/)?)
