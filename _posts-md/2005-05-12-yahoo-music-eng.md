Update: Eww, buck-chew-tak stamp. "per Month" i also read as "per Year". Typo corrected.  
  
Sounds like interesting stuff, based on Napster-To-Go model.. but [YME](http://music.yahoo.com/musicengine/) is only USD $5 for a YEAR month subscription. How many [CDs can you rip now](http://blog.kordix.com/marv/archives/000400.html) [if it comes out of a speaker, it can go into a mic and onto my harddisk]? Sounds like a good deal.  
  
Yay, price war! $0.99 a song! $5 a year month! $10 for your lifetime, your children's lifetime and their children's lifetime!
