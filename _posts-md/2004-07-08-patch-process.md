[Patching](http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/Microsoft_patch_process.html) seems to be a slower process than cracking.   
  
Now, isn't that so oxymoron-ly unnecessary? You wrote the affected software, you got the code. Can't companies write a better, faster spreading "virus" to patch 'em? Duh.
