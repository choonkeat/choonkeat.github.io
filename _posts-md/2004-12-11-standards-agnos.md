Its precisely because of [RSS's Flexibility](http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=822&tag=nl.e539) and Atom's existence that I'd written [RssFwd](http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/) in the most standards-ignorant approach. Had I went on to [read](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss) the RSS spec, stuck to standards, and fret over why [some](http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A%2F%2Fradio.weblogs.com%2F0001011%2Frss.xml) [people](http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.sun.com%2Froller%2Frss%2Fjonathan) didn't do it the best-practiced way... I would've long pulled my hair out. Instead, if-this-exist-else-use-that-or-that-or-that dirty approach has worked well for me mentally and technically.  
  
Btw, you can [subscribe](http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A//blog.yanime.org/xml/rss/feed.xml) to my rants ;-)
