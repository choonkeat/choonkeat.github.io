Love has been debating with me on what Jason Mraz's been mouthing in a very popular song recently, [You & I Both](http://www.jasonmraz.com/Lyrics/YouAndIBoth.html). It was until this afternoon that we'd settled it once and for all, with the help of my [bestest friend](http://www.google.com/). I still can't believe he could sing "What you and I spoke of" in 2-syllabus?! Or what seems like 2 syllabus to me.. it certainly sounded like he was saying "You and I both Loved.. Hougang.. ".

Love says I'm crazy and deaf. Dear SG, listen to the song (the next time) and tell me if I'm entirely off.

Btw, got myself a moblog (wee!) though its not a DIY and neither is it integrated into this blog.. at least that's something!
