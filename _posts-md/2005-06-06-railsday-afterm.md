After 24hrs.. Railsday ended yesterday 1pm local time. I stank.

Glancing at the app I wrote, I said "_Damn! 24 hours and only this? I should've finished it in a couple of hours!_" But that's hindsight. The most demoralising moment during the competition was when I followed a Railsday update and looked at [some ppl'sscreenshot](http://www.anarchogeek.com/images/nutrient_screenshot.png). Regrets? Sure, I should've been more prepared. My stylesheets and design looked like it was picked up from the trash, crumpled, rethrown and pasted on the web. I did realise early on that "_look and feel is important!_" and decided to delegate the last 3 hours into just that.. no matter what ok? last 3 hours, spruce it up! Yeaahh rite. Also, I should've charted out detailed milestones early on, and just execute duringRailsday- and don't deviate from the plan! Shuffling my feet costed me a good few hours.

I don't think I'm getting that PSP, iPodor Mac Mini. But! That wasn't my stated reason of my participation yah? (save face) It was learning, and learning I did. Because of the nature of my app (for others to write an app), I don't think I can safely put up it up for trying anytime soon. But, if you're interested to see what others has _beautifully_ done, try visiting: [list of some of them](http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2005/06/05/playing-with-rails-day-projects#comments), [Friendr](http://friendr.com/user/login), [Space Tag](http://spacetag.allconsuming.net/), [Nutrient](http://66.92.15.36/), [Tackboard](http://tackboard.trivialbydesign.com/), [some google map thing](http://overstimulate.com/articles/2005/06/05/rails-lesson-learned), and the adventurous people can check out the projects directly from the [SVN repository described](http://railsday.com/svn/).
