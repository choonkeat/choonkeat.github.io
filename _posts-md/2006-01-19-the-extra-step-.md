I've tried to skirt this for very long now, mostly because I'd leaned heavily towards simplicity (this extra step just seem so troublesome...)

Anyways, many bad encounters today (it never rains, but pours) so patched RssFwd to require a "[email verification check](http://www.spamcop.net/fom-serve/cache/104.html)" for **all new subscribers**. If your email address (or any permutation of it) is not in the database, you're a new subscriber and will have to respond to a verification email. For existing subscribers already in the database, I'd taken the liberty to set you guys as "confirmed" to avoid any service disruption.

\*sigh\*

But hey, at least my service adheres to Singapore's [proposed Spam Control Bill](http://james.seng.sg/archives/2005/09/12/proposed_spam_control_bill_for_singapore.html) now.
