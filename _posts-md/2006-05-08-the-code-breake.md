Just got to know there'll be a neat BBC documentary on Free/Open Source Software. Excluding the unearthly 3:30am and 5:30pm showtimes.. the more feasible showtime for Singapore will be: (for other timezones, pls check [at BBC directly](http://www.bbcworld.com/content/template_tvlistings.asp?pageid=668))

(This hcal output was made using [hCalendar creator](http://microformats.org/code/hcalendar/creator), neat! Editors should have hcal built in!)
