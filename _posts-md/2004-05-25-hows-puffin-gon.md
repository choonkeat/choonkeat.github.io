Lemme see.. in order to be fast, well integrated UI... [Puffin](http://www.google.com.sg/search?q=puffin+google&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search&meta=) will hafta..   
1. Indexing

> a) Background / Screen-saver indexing of your harddisk (boring.. )  
> b) 1-time indexing 'wizard' when installing (boring.. )  
> c) All of the above, plus newly created/updated files are monitored and indexed as per Anti-virus does.

2. Searching: Indexes will be several times larger than the content itself, so where are all these gonna be residing?  

> a) Google will host, so Puffin actually searches your indexes online (hosted by Google). So, your harddisk search will be as _slow_ as your google search.. (\*ringgggggggg\* privacy alarms goes off) but that's still faster than searching for anything in your hddisk now!

  
Any bright ideas anyone?
