Managed to catch "[The Revenge of the Dim Sum Dollies](http://www.esplanade.com/SOPApp/espsop/portal_proxy?GXHC_gx_session_id_=e542a12114f9c83b&GXHC_IMP_COOKIE=e542a12114f9c83b&uri=tgT_xhMJoh-8eZ!0WH6clUQnDWOFt2HQtm@5_AaXmdLzvdh4NNTRPASA_2h,cGAgsJFM)" last weekend... I must say, the white cabbage (ask Glen Ong!) is really funny.. especially liked the mat-rock-mix song, Parking Pontianah (depicting the woes of the URA parking attendant, aka Aunty Lilly).. thoroughly hillarious! At some point in the show, I almost couldn't catch my own breath.. darn good one Selina!

"You call me the Parking Pontianah.. you curse me loud-ly.. you curse me loud-ly.. uh uh!  
 You call me the Parking Pontianah.. I do my job proud-ly, I do my job proud-ly, uh uh!"  

   
 However, I must say I'm much dismayed with the CD purchased. The funniest part of the whole show were the stand-up jokes, between acts, etc.. unfortunately the CD only featured studio recorded songs.. boo hoo. I would've better desired a live recording that includes everything - including laughs from the crowd.. oh well!  
   
Dollies dollies.. saw another VCD too.. took away only 1 quote with me..
