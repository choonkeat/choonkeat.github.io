Awesome video. Checkout what this guy did with Google Earth: [Virtual tour around Seattle](http://www.leanbackvids.com/videoblog/seattle/mirror-world/) [embeds huge .mov file] Makes me feel Seattle is kewl :-D and wanting more.. NYDC? But alas, Singapore is only a splat of green and brown, with scatters of clouds in Google Earth...
