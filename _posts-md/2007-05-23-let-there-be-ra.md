Checkout this enlightening presentation by Ezra Zygmuntowicz: [http://brainspl.at/articles/2007/05/20/my-xen-and-the-art-of-rails-deployment-talk-slides](http://brainspl.at/articles/2007/05/20/my-xen-and-the-art-of-rails-deployment-talk-slides) <sup><a href="http://r3.sharedcopy.com/5sph0de6#shcp2">»</a></sup>

[Rails Stacks](http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-stack). Yep. [Rails distros](../../articles/2006/01/02/crazy-thoughts-a-rails-distribution) (where "distro" refers [this kind](http://www.linux.org/info/faq1.html#faq.q3)) coming RealSoonNow. Though frankly I hadn't envision it to be served as virtual machine images - talk about bleeding edge!
