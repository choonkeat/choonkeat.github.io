[TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/) has taken to discuss [syndication of RSS content with e-mail](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/02/13/blogs-need-an-email-solution/), in response to Fred Wilson's [RSS vs Email series](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/09/email_vs_rss_co.html). And I'm very grateful for the good words on [RssFwd.com](http://www.rssfwd.com/) in the comments. **Thanks folks!!**

Michael goes on to write his wishlist for an ideal feed to email service, one of it is "_I am in control of the email list; no spamming by the service provider_". Hmm, I have a different take, but that's [another story](../../articles/2005/11/20/faq-as-a-publisher-will-i-have-access-to-the-email-addresses-of-my-subscribers-like-feedblitz-does).

As for templates,... actually, instead of paying for customisation, how about feeds returning "templated and email-ready" content when the user-agent is a known email-aggregator? Just a thought.

Update: Customized footers are [now available](../../../articles/2006/03/05/upgrade). Just let me know if you need customisations.
