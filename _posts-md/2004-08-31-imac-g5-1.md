Love pass me this link: http://www.apple.com/imac/ (brand new, hot from the oven!)  
  
My initial thoughts goes something like ".. they've departed from the original iMac all-in-one design.. now this looks just like any other G5.. " only for a moment there.. perhaps the webpage did a little cough and begged my attention further.. there is no CPU!  
  
One can argue that the first iMac are candy drops and looks much cuter blah blah.. but i like this one very much.  
  
iMac v1.0 shames the PC hardware designers. iMac v2.0 shames the Laptop & PC hardware designers. Makes u look differently at your notebook now, aye?
