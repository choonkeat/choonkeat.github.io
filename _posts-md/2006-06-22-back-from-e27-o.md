[E27](http://www.entrepreneur27.org/sg/?p=22) turned out quite well :-) though lengthy Q&As could've been better controlled with some Oscar music and _ushered to be_ _continued_ _in the corridors_. Or maybe its just me being the last presenter!

Thanks [Justin](http://www.justinlee.name/) & [Bjorn](http://bjornlee.wordpress.com/) for organising this event! Sorry I had to swap in with a laptop, as my Nokia thumbdrive died on me (remind self: never use storage device from handphone maker and [never use handphone from a refrigerator maker](../../articles/2005/01/28/old-is-better-new-is-just-more))

The yet-to-be-formed singapore.rb was there as well. We had actually piggy backed on this event for a brief gathering. Though only 3 of us were there (4 I think? But we didn't get to connect), it was sure nice to see fellow Railers in the same room (Hi Doug & Billy)... perhaps a good prep for [the big one](http://www.railsconf.org/) tmrw.

Oh well, \*yawn\* looks like I gotta sleep before the flight after all...
