Then last weekend, Borders threw 30% discount for people who bothered to cut coupons like NTUC aunties...

Love had intended to use it for [Freakonomics](http://www.freakonomics.com/)... but since mine is more expensive, its more worthwhile to use it on mine... besides I offered to pay hers.. hmm.. hmmm? what did that 30% discount do for me, again? Who cares!?  
  
And today, as I'm glancing lovingly at my preciousssss, new Pickaxe.. my [Rails book](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/) arrived!
