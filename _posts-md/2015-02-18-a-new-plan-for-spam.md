title: 'A New Plan for Spam: Turing'

Background: Spammers don’t really mind when you delete their spam mails or “mark as spam”. Same reason [they want to be obviously spam](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/167713/WhyFromNigeria.pdf): they only want to spend time communicating with the gullible. If they have to spend time communicating with people who wouldn’t end up being tricked (aka false positive), it would greatly increase their cost of business.

[Thomas Bayes](http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html) has served us well for a few years, now is [a great time](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/) to employ Alan Turing’s help.

I propose to have an “F1” competition of sorts, for companies (or talented individuals) working on AI and NLP. Here’s the competition challenge:

**Hold a conversation with a spammer for as long as possible #TuringTest**

The entity that accumulates the longest durations over a period of time, e.g. 1 year, is champion for the year.

To do this, ironically, we need spam. We’ll need mail clients (e.g. Mail.app, Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook) to rewire “mark as spam” to deliver, round robin, spams mails to everyone participating in the `#F1forAI` competition.

From there, the end points will communicate with the spammer onbehalf of the end user, likely using the same SMTP server to hide scent.

And, that’s about it really.

Oh, yes we need a global ranking table, like the one Dropbox created for their [Great Space Race](https://www.dropbox.com/spacerace)
