Kewl! [Activate](http://www.activateinteractive.com/) is <!--StartFragment -->[developing a Mobile Massively Multiplayer Online, PC-mobile, cross-platform Symbian game for N-Gage](http://i-newswire.com/pr9710.html). (That's a mouthful! MMMOPCMCPSG4NG!!)

> Nokia and Activate has announced on 10 March 2005, the development of a revolutionary PC-mobile phone cross-platform Symbian game. Created by Nokia for promotion in the Asia-Pacific region, and developed by Singapore-based Activate Interactive, HinterWars: The Aterian Invasion is a Mobile Massively Multiplayer Online Game (3MOG) that allows gamers to play simultaneously with tens of thousands of others using either their Nokia N-Gage gamedeck or their PC.

The company is indeed turning kewler by the day. Kudos. And perhaps its (at last) time to install that webcam in office ;-)
