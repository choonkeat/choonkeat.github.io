A nice little [article in Wired](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/internet/0,72542-0.html?tw=rss.index) yesterday mentions [RssFwd](http://www.rssfwd.com/)

> The Feed Is in the Mail  
> Even some the best RSS clients lack compelling archiving features -- older headlines drop out of sight after a day or two. Thankfully, sites like RMail and RSSfwd provide simple archiving by delivering feeds to your e-mail account.

"Archiving"? Hmm. I wonder if the writer has [read this](http://www.kbcafe.com/juice/?guid=20050424102714) before, regarding [RMail](http://www.r-mail.org/) [emphasis mine]

> ...emails are sent every hour, on the hour, **at most one email per hour**.

Absolutely nothing wrong with that policy. A conscious decision to protect the subscriber's mailbox. However, it also means that if you've subscribed to [high](http://slashdot.org/) [traffic](http://digg.com/) feeds for archival purposes, you'd be in for a _little_ surprise when you discover your archive isn't anywhere complete. (Note below: **Highlighted are emails from Rmail** , the rest is from RssFwd. Both are subscriptions to the same Slashdot feed.)

Something missing?

There are really many RSS-to-Email services out there. Some has accounts and passwords, some [can only be used for certain feeds only](http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/publishers/emailsub), some [sends 1 email daily unless you pay](http://www.feedblitz.com/features.asp), many has complex features, and there are some which [simply sends an email for each update](http://www.rssfwd.com/). Each serve its own target audience. Do make sure you are the correct audience.
