In case some of you have not been following, and are still holding "_J2EE vs .NET_", or "_Java vs .Net_" debates... there's a substitute going on inside the ring. Its now becoming a more inclusive JVM vs .NET.

 

And this time, the [casts](http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/09/jruby-steps-into-sun.html) [promises](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython) to be much more [interesting](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060810-7462.html).

 

Heck, everything's going on virtual! Soon you'll be typing on that virtual keyboard on your Intel box that boots up a virtual operating system image to visit your virtual online store that is written in JScheme running on top of the Java virtual machine. But maybe then, _virtual_ and _online_ becomes default enough that we stop prefixing nouns with it.
