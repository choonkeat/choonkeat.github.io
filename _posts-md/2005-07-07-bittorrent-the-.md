Apparently [Opera browser is embedding](http://operawatch.blogspot.com/2005/07/opera-adds-support-for-bit-torrent.html) a Bittorrent client in its next version. Kewl. Hopefully other browsers follow suit.  
  
But that's it. Until web servers becomes Bittorrent capable themselves, Bittorrent will remain more a software than a protocol. Otherwise, it'll be smooth and transparent like [HTTP compression headers](http://webreference.com/internet/software/servers/http/compression/3.html) that most of us already benefit from without even realising its there.  
  
And from the [bickering](http://www.livejournal.com/users/bramcohen/6531.html), looks like nothing is going to change (Maybe it'll take a MS implementation to Apache into action?).
