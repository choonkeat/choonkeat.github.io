SharedCopy was [Techcrunched](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/10/bookmark-copy-note-and-share-sharedcopycom) a few hours ago. A more positive milestone than [the previous one](../../articles/2006/04/03/rssfwd-blocked-in-china) to say the least!

I'm very thrilled and will blog a bit more laters. Haven't been a good blogger lately, only have been making commentaries over here: [http://sharedcopy.com/public/users/choonkeat](http://sharedcopy.com/public/users/choonkeat)

Wouldn't it be awesome to [integrate](http://sharedcopy.com/public/api) that with blogging platforms?
