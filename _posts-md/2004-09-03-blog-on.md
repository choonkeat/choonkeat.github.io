[Friendster's firing](http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104_2-5331835.html) is nothing new (see [microsoft](http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/03/10/29/1421223.shtml?tid=109&tid=187)).. but may warrant more attention to casual bloggers to: "Never tell them your real name!"  
But probably a corporate-like disclaimer will do..   
  
DISCLAIMER: All postings on this web site are purely FICTIONAL - it is not actually written, does not exist and if all else fails its 100% virtual anyways, why take it too seriously? Any resemblence between anyone and any real person, living or dead, is an merely a COINCIDENCE.  
  
Now.. blog on!
