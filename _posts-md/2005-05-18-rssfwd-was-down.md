Sorry rssfwd users. Was just talking about running out of space (sheesh!) and the database just cronked out a while ago.. lucky thing is, its just the cache table.. but it also mean you may miss updates from your feeds of the past hour or so. Updating the cache table now.. so that you guys won't get spammed from re-sends..

Very very sorry about that. I'm already looking to upgrade the server. Please bear with me til then.

Thanks
