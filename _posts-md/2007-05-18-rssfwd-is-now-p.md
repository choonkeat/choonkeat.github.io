I'm happy to announce that [RssFwd](http://www.rssfwd.com/) is now part of [Blue Sky Factory](http://www.blueskyfactory.com/)! W00t!

Thanks y'all for the support and continuing to use the service. Just to allay some of your fears

- I didn't "sell email addresses", i.e. you'll not get spammed _because of this_  
- RssFwd continues to be free  
- I'm still hands on!  

[Greg](http://www.thetrendjunkie.com/2007/05/17/we-acquired-rssfwd/) brings with him a years of experience in the realm of email and [syndication](http://www.roiradio.com/). His energy and ideas certainly means the RssFwd service will only improve.

This is a good birthday present :-)
