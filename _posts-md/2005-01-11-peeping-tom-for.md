First there was [talk](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/04/googling_unsecured_w.html) about people installing webcams and not having them secured and that these cameras are actually searchable and viewable via Google. Then there's [more talk](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/05/more_googleable_unse.html)... Now, [this guy](http://ming.tv/flemming2.php/__show_article/_a000010-001449.htm) has written up [a page so easy even my grandma can use to see any open cameras around the freaking world](http://www.opentopia.com/hiddencam.php)!! [click on the images to control the actual camera]  
  
Of cos, I do think he did that for fun and the kind of reverse-psycho way that writing [AirSnort](http://airsnort.shmoo.com/) [Wireless-Network-Hacking-For-Dummies] will help make wireless network safer by means of "wake up your freaking idea".  
  
Remember to wash your eyes, else see buck chum.
