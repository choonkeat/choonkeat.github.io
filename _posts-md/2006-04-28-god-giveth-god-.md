I can't imagine going back to life without [my bestest friend](http://www.google.com/): Now, where do I _start_ finding stuff for my work? Its incredible... and is probably the biggest productivity tool _eva_.

But today, my bestest friend released [SketchUp](http://sketchup.google.com/tutorials.html). A spiffy (only 19mb) cool 3D modelling tool... that integrates with Google Earth. Pfft! There goes my TODO list for the day.

And ya, and the best thing is... SketchUp is script-able with [Ruby](http://download.sketchup.com/OnlineDoc/M-Technical_Reference/Tech-Ruby.htm).
