This [template\_optimizer](http://railsexpress.de/blog/articles/2006/08/15/rails-template-optimizer-beta-test) plugin looks great. If it can compile for [KRJS](../../articles/tag/krjs) too, that'll remove its only drawback of slower rendering speed due to method inspection. Any one with a free hand to give it a try?
