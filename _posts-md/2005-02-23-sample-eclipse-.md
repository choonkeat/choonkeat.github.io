title: Sample Eclipse Action (with Keybindings) in a Existing Menu

Did a short program that basically gives you the Ctrl-Tab keyboard shortcut for tabbing between editors. Strange that its such a default keyboard shortcut, even Firefox has it, that Eclipse doesn't come with it. Hmm?  
  
Anyways, feel free to check it out (source codes included) [[download zip](http://www.yanime.org/keatCtrlTabWindows.zip)]   
  
Note: This software is provided AS-IS. Use at your own risk.  
Note: More details on how to get your actions into other existing menus, see [IBM website](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/ad51help/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/guide/workbench_menupaths.htm).
