For those interested in Web Services, and thinking what the f is [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX) all hyped about? Jon Udell has a great [article](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/06/14.html#a1250) that answers questions like:

  
"...got me to thinking about why we (that's you and me -- Web users) are OK with degraded user experiences. I mean, for years we had great desktop applications to do things like calendaring and email and even mapping software... And now we're all very excited about things like Evite, Gmail, and Google maps. But compare Google Maps to Streets and Trips, which I did recently, and the experience with S&T is much better..."  

  
  
This is also reason to believe that fat-client will never dispose of thin-client, regardless of how much $$ is pushing it. Because [Web DNA and no Windows tax](http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/03/04/10OPstrategic_1.html) is more fun.  
  
Looks like its only drizzling now. Off to work!
