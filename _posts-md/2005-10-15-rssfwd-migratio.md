The long awaited migration (parts at a time) of the rssfwd operations is taking place. I'll try to reduce the downtime  
  
In the meantime, if you have any inbox filters setup pls filter the from email address as only "rssfwd"... excluding the full address "@yanime.org". As the migration also means that yanime.org and rssfwd.com will be separate servers now, you'll be getting emails from a different email address hence.  
  
Sorry about that. This should be the last of email changes for rssfwd.
