Yes, [rumour](http://www.threadwatch.org/node/3560)! Yes, [screen](http://labnol.blogspot.com/2005/08/google-instant-messenger-screenshot.html) [shots](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dirson/36423148/)! Yes, [confirmed server running](http://people.sysnetworks.net/apardo/images/talk.google.jpg)! At last, Google Instant Messenger is coming... [TODAY](http://www.paidcontent.org/pc/arch/2005_08_22.shtml#015451).  
  
Let's just hope

  
1. 100% [Jabber](http://www.jabber.org/)-compliant protocol - so I can pick a favourite [Jabber-enabled IM app](http://www.jabber.org/software/clients.shtml). Open market wins?  
  
2. Can re-use gmail email address as Messenger ID, not another ID-Password pls
  
3. They're running all the gateway transports ([lets u comms with buddies on MSN, Yahoo, ICQ, AOL, blah..](http://www.jabber.org/user/userfaq.shtml#id2780730)) - this one quite hard, sure clash with other companies...  
  
  
Privacy? You never had - get over it (unless you've been using [Tor](http://tor.eff.org/overview.html))  

  
Update: Ok, [Google Talk released](http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/08/23.html#a249). [2 out of 3](http://www.google.com/talk/developer.html).   
  
  

> We plan to partner with other willing service providers to enable federation of our services.

  
  
  
Update 2: Acknowledged. Without avatar/picture, emoticons... and Google Talk itself can't be used as a generic Jabber client... \*sigh\* still quite lame, only a hardcore fan like me can get excited.
