Blogger Wuming\_Gong reports that [RssFwd is inaccessible](http://spaces.msn.com/wgong/Blog/cns!47B353A64E7FC0B4!132.entry) from within the Great Firewall of China. Its the equivalence of finding your proprietary software cracked on [Astalavista](http://astalavista.box.sk/) - a _good_ problem indicating your software has arrived.
