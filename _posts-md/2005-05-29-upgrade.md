Finally.. after a couple of hours of labour pain.. I've upggraded to the latest Rails, upgraded Rssfwd (now non-english characters appear nicely in the email From and Subject! Yippie!), and finally upgraded my blog to use [Typo](http://typo.leetsoft.com/) (a blog app written with Rails). So much for forcing myself to learn PHP by installing Plog \*sheepish\*. Moreover, at the rate Rails is picking momentum Typo is sure to benefit and getting many fun integration with the latest-kewl-thing.  
  
So, when I get rested, perhaps I'll personalise the layout etc.. (this default one looks rather good actually.. but Love misses her old layout)  
  
Sorry if I'd broken some of your rss aggregator's subscription.. For those subscribed under Rssfwd, I've made the necessary ammendments (of cos).  
  
Cheers!
