I've been hacked once before. I know what [she means](http://xiaxue.blogspot.com/2005/07/my-blog-got-hacked.html). Feels like shit. Anyone with any way of helping, I'm sure she'd appreciate. [Spread the word](http://xiaxue.blogspot.com/2005/07/i-want-to-catch-culprit.html). I'm not a fan, but that's not a reason not to lift a finger.

Update: [WonkyTong](http://wonkytong.blogspot.com/2005/07/hacked.html) hacked too? This is either :

  
- a sick meme
  
- blogger security hole
  
- blogger.sg wireless trap (but wonkytong didn't go right?
  
  
Given that there's no related news in the rest of the world.. i think its a geographical thing. Ppl, pls refer to [mrbrown's cautionary notes for XX's incident](http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2005/07/xiaxues_email_a.html). For now, I'm changing my passwords.  
  
  
Somebody just passed me another blogger's URL - and the first thought, '_Huh, so-and-so hacked too?_'. Damn, today is the only day you'll not want to see your blog listed on mrbrown's.
