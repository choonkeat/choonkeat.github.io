Remember those dorky <font><strong>green</strong></font>/<font><strong>red</strong></font> 3D glasses you wear to see 3D films? Saw one in [Omni-Theatre](http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/otmovie.jsp?type=8&root=0&parent=0&cat=82) donkey years ago.. Apparently there's been technology to bring such images to your eyes without the need to wear those glasses. Kewl. Check out [Sharp 3D](http://www.sharp3d.com/technology/howsharp3dworks).

Now Sharp is sellin [Linux Laptops](http://www.sharpsystems.com/products/pc_notebooks/actius/al/3du/) with this autostero technology. Wonder if NTUC will pick that up..
