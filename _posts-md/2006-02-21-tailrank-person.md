[Tailrank](http://tailrank.com/) is a memetracker, like memeorandum, and it groups related items together in a thread, like Google News. And naturally, threads with more buzz ranks on top.

 

If it had just stopped there, it would've just been yet-another. However, [Kevin](http://www.feedblog.org/) had the smarts to introduce personalisation. What does meme + personalisation give me?

 
- **Meme/clustering** : soften the noise, group related items for me - so I can skim through faster, notice the big (arguably important) news and hence keep in touch with more sources (I'm currently reading ~200 feeds, people like [Scoble](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/) reads over a thousand... !)  
- **Personalised ranking** : the idea of using OPML to help me personalised is quite ingenius. Now I don't have to explicitly tell the system what I like using hard, cold, insensitive keywords like, e.g. rss, ruby, ajax, etc.. I just give the system an OPML file (the defacto representation of a "subscription list"), meaning "_here's what I read, show me what is important to me_".. akin to Amazon's "_here are the books I bought, now recommend me a new book_"
 

Though I like the implicitness of importing OPML to "set" my preferences, the fact that an OPML file has to be used might probably leave out a larger population - if RSS adoption is 4%... OPML is probably...

 

I wonder if there're more straightforward sources could be used to infer... and hence making the service more inclusive? My [del.ici.ous](http://del.icio.us/) bookmarks? My [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) photos? My homepage? My browser bookmarks? My browser history (oh.. too private)?
