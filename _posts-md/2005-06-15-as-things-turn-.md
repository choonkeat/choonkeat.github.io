97 days ago, I made a [long rant about my thoughts on (imho) the most appropriate framework for editing XML files](http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2005/03/10/the-framework-for-editing-xml-document).  
  
Today, no more what-if scenarios. Reality has several points proven: mad rush to complete models implementation whilst beta testing postponed, missed model implementations lead to strange errors and lost data when saving.  
  
Refactor now?
