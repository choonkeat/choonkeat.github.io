Scanning in whole libraries as searchable is a joke.. a pain.. but Google said they were going to do it. Fine! You have man-power.. what I cannot stand is [how unimaginably good the results page looks](http://print.google.com/print?id=UZ3jwGRBLnQC&prev=http://print.google.com/print%3Fq%3Dphilosophy&pg=xxv&sig=DKTz4Mb0sxaG3WdoxdpY8tR0PlA). Gross! Checkout the highlighted terms, the scanned image of the page itself, page numberings.. utterly gross!

And just when you think "that's a nice example demo, real results isn't so nice..", notice the little box on the left there? Type in "happiness" or any word u see on the existing images and click search.. [GROSS! It works!](http://print.google.com/print?id=UZ3jwGRBLnQC&prev=http://print.google.com/print%3Fq%3Dphilosophy&pg=xxv&sig=DKTz4Mb0sxaG3WdoxdpY8tR0PlA)
