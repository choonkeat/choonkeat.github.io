E27 in coming again @ [SMU Building 6 (PDF)](http://www.smu.edu.sg/campus/pdf/smu_map.pdf). One of the best places to see new ideas, grab talent when they're young and (my favourite) give unsolicited comments on other people's business model or technical implementation :-D

[Current lineup](http://www.entrepreneur27.org/sg/next-event/):

- Virtual Worlds and MMORPGs
- Complex Networks in a Simple World
- ActiveDeals.com - interactive video content over the MSN instant messenger platform
- Wisheus.com - social wishlist service
- Tylerprojects.com - developer of mobile and web games

You're invited. RSVP [here](http://entrepreneur27singapore.wikispaces.com/).
