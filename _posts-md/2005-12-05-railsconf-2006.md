Just when I'd set the date to visit my friend in NYC (postponed thrice!) in Apr.. comes the announcement of [RailsConf](http://www.railsconf.org/) in end June '06. I would really prefer visiting US of A at a cooler climate.

 "24 degree celsius. That's Singapore's weather on a good day", Love quipped  

  
  
And, flying from [New York to Chicago](http://rss.farecompare.com/rss/viewResults?departure=NYC&destination=CHI) would raise my total expenditure by at least SGD $1200.. I'm not exactly feeling too rich at the moment.  
  
From the rate Rails is growing... this is too big to miss...   
  
I wonder if [paypal donations](http://www.rssfwd.com) can get me there. Hmm.
