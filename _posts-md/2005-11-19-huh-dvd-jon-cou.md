Surprised by [DVD Jon's post](http://nanocrew.net/2005/11/18/22-am-i-old-enough/) yesterday. First of all, I was surprised the said Singaporean manufacturer was actually kewl enough to see past a sue and actually offered him a job... then, I'm surprised they didn't even respond to him. I don't think its got to do with the age - I'm quite sure they've gotten so far as to have offered him a job, they'd at least paid him a free-lance fee to do next driver.   
  
Actually I'm not sure what company it is. [RFC Distribution](http://it.asia1.com.sg/reviews/storage/sto001_19990705.html)? It could be because they went under.. since [searching](https://www.psi.gov.sg/NASApp/tmf/TMFServlet?app=RCB-BIZFILE-BIZCODIR) the company name yields no results.  
  
Who is DVD Jon? Well, he's the guy who sparked the find of the world's first prime number..
