As [requested by a few of you](http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2005/07/15/rssfwd-special-treatment-for-laggards#comments), incl Love and myself :-P, I've made [Rssfwd's main page](http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd) lighter with a 'popular | all' switch just above the tag cloud.  
  
Sorry, things happened and couldn't go about implementing OPML import/export last weekend. Soon.. soon :-P  
  
I hope I have time to talk about and implement [clustering](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.asp?p=398884&rl=1). Here's [why rssfwd will definitely need it](http://rssdiary.marketingstudies.net/content/when_there_is_too_much_rss.php).
