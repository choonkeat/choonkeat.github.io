[Wow](http://demo.com/demonstrators/demo2006/63003.html). Krugle looks like something that'll be super useful to me, considering I've been swimming in the sea of _Eclipse plugin development_ today... very unproductive. Nice demo... enlightened me of what the vertical search market is about.

 

Wonder if it can do searches like,

 



> **get:** org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell   
> **using:** org.eclipse.ui.IActionDelegate

  
I tell ya, if something can help me **chain up** the list of "potential methods" from 1 class (that I have) to another class (that I'm trying to get at)... that'll really flatten out the learning curve of any new platform/library/watever...
