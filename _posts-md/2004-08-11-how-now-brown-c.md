I give up.. weeks ago CERT told everyone [not to use IE anymore](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/713878/) and every open source zealot (yes, me) started chanting, 'Firefox! Firefox! Firefox! '.. I'd even managed to convert a couple of friends recently (1 end user, 1 developer) to junk IE related browsers.   
  
But hey, now there's [Firefox UI Spoofing](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5403)? \*Phooey\* (note to self: Gotta learn XUL!)  
  
So my options now are.. \*drum roll\*  
4. Use [Op(lease)era](http://www.opera.com/) browser. (hello adware)  
3. Use text browser [Lynx](http://www.osvdb.org/displayvuln.php?osvdb_id=1234) (bye bye pr0n pics)  
2. Use telnet (bye bye modern world)  
1. Use another person's PC.  
  
-sigh-
