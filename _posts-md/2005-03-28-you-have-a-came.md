You've got what it takes. The monitor you're looking at now, and that camera (phone)... go take a [transparent-screen](http://www.flickr.com/groups/transparentscreens/pool/)! Put up something nice! And if anything, the [slideshow makes a nice screensaver](http://www.flickr.com/groups/transparentscreens/pool/show/)..

The good thing with my messy desk at home.. I didn't have to create a mess for the shot! :-D. Unfortunately, my camera phone (which sux by the way) has not so good resolution. Note that only the first shot (of the background) is edited and set as wallpaper... the second (final) shot is not supposed to be edited.

So.. camera enthusiasts, designers, what are u waiting for? Nat? Suki? Goh? YP? TKY? Dave Ang? Show me yours!?
