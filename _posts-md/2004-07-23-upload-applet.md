Was chatting with my friend the other day.. and he complained that there's no easy to use drag-drop capability in web technology.. well, you can with a signed applet - apparently [some other company](http://www.radinks.com/upload/applet.php) already has a working product that does that.. just that its very ugly and cost money.  
  
Hence, I shall embark on yet-another "because there should be better" journey.. and do something like that, open sourced. Maybe a addon to [J'upload](http://freshmeat.net/projects/jupload/) so as to minimize the wheel-reinvented. Let me know if anyone's interested to do the shit work.  
  
The motto of the applet will be.. "_Uploading, the way it should've been since day-1_" (So, maybe its name is UTWISBSD1) Its aim.. so highly configurable, it should outright replace the icky "Browse" button.  
  
Cheers
