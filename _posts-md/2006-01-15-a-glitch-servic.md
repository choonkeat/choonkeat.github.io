title: A Glitch. Service Disruption.

Users of RssFwd service would've noticed a drop in emails received over the weekend, and yes, something was wrong. Mainly the new bounced-mail handler was over-zealous causing quite a lot of unnecessary subscription suspension.

I am very sorry for the glitch.

But as the Playstation executive said in The Apprentice, "_Don't be sorry, just make it right_".... so the "good news" is, I do have records of all the subscriptions that were incorrectly removed, and am already in progress of restoring them right now. At things should be back to normal in a couple of hour's time.

Thanks for bearing with me.

(Note to self, listen to your instincts.)
