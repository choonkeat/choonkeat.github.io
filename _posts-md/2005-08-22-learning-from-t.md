Ok, last night's Apprentice (the GT4 graffiti episode) taught me something. Something _more_ this time... because I lost. Or at least it almost felt like it. When the task was revealed, I had (in my mind) come up with almost the exact design of the losing team!! And though the post-production editing gave me hints which team was going to win... I just couldn't be _convinced_ - and upon hearing the Sony guys "_knew clearly_" which was the winning team.. "_it was obvious_"... I was even more puzzled.  
  
Hearing the interviewed members of the focus groups talking about how they like the winning designs better, etc... I realised I'd known nothing about those consumer's concerns - and I'm a consumer. I even played (and love) GT3.  
  
So, before I get into yet another design-revamp-launch-get-feedback-that-its-ugly cycle.. I guess I better show you guys (my focus groups) a mock up of the spanking new, more professional looking RssFwd design.  
  
Let me know what you think: [Minimalistic Design #1](http://www.rssfwd.com/mockup/index.html).  
  
Some FAQ:

  
1. **Where did the ads go?** Well.. I haven't found a good place to put them without sacrificing asthetics, so perhaps until then, it'll be donations only.
  
2. **Where's all the info?** I'll stick them properly into the various sub pages, with the same font as "Enter a feed URL to subscribe" - and rid myself of silly less-pages-is-better mantra..   
  
3. **What's with the picture - RssFwd isn't a desktop app?!** Actually, I'm intending RssFwd to be a desktop app - to relieve myself of some bandwidth/load... besides I think the browser-inside-browser-infinite thing is hilarious (Love didn't think so)
