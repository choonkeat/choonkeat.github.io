I've been using MMS in the most under-utilising manner: Sending "don't forget" text notes to my gmail. I bet some of you will say, '50cents for text?'. But to me, it is 50cents to remember a good idea.  
  
37signals is taking this idea even further. To be precise, having that as just [one of the feature](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/backpack_preview_3_web_10_calling_web_20.php) of their secrety-next-kewl-thing: [Backpack](http://backpackit.com/). I await.  
  
Full disclosure: Yes, I'm a 37signals fan. But, these days, [who isn't](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/04/designing_from.html)?
