Version control is the best thing since sliced bread (for those whom have [just learnt of it](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/timemachine.html)). But once [branching](http://www.ericsink.com/scm/scm_branches.html) comes into the picture, it is becomes a [hairy](../../articles/2006/05/24/version-control-that-missing-module-in-cs101) thing.

It might be because humans aren't accustomed to think in terms of parallel universe (perhaps sci-fi authors). There appears to have no "_one right way_" to cater for all scenarios. I used to live and breath on the _trunk-is-stable-and-latest_ camp (half sneering at enterprisey people who '_branch first__, then merge_'). But it just happens that my past situations only requires so much.

Furthermore, some people just prefer the branch-merge-often mentality, others thrive in simplicity of trunk-work-branch-maintain workflow. Like tea people and coffee people. Just different. No point converting anyone over to the other side. Hence I was dabbling to create a script (on-top-of [svnmerge](http://www.dellroad.org/svnmerge/index)) to provide dead-simple branch/merge workflow - so trunk ppl can have it so, and branch ppl won't be inconvenienced.

That's when I found [SVK](http://svk.elixus.org/). By saying its a "_decentralized version control system built with the Subversion filesystem_" is really really doing it a huge disservice. My layman version would be "_SVK lets you be the branch-merge person you are inside, or the trunk-branch, or watever \*%^#$ person you like to do your work in - whilst sharing a common repository with people of different taste! I mean, its like a cup that lets you sip coffee, sit around with everyone, whilst sharing the same pot of tea!_"

SVK has more commands to do magic, but the daily stuff closely resembles SVN: svk commit; svk update; svk diff. It also has another benefit - it doesn't pollute your working directory with hidden _.svn_ or _CVS_ folders/files. [Some ppl](http://thegrok.wordpress.com/) are irked by that. Those files are consolidated in your home directory. Actually that might be good / bad depending on you being a tea or coffee person.

The only drawback is that IDE integration is lacking at the moment. And most importantly, the tickets / changesets information on [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) wouldn't tally directly with my local mirror.

Oh well, these might not be show stopper after all. Let's see how it goes when I use it for real.
