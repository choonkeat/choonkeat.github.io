Arghhh!! 1 week after launch of Backpack, they released [Backpack mobile](http://feeds.feedburner.com/37signals/beMH?m=333).. 2nd week (now) its [APIs](http://www.backpackit.com/api/)! Now I reaaaaally have to find time play with my backpack account. Dammit! Checkout [rael's ideas on mixing Backpack with Amazon](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/05/new_way_of_doin.html)..   
  
And then, there's PS3 [checkout the [video](http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3140617)].. there's [kewl kewl RC cars](http://tomorrow.sg/archives/2005/05/17/radio-controlled_car_drift.html) (btw, these SG Drifters can [help SAF](http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/05/rc_cars_on_the.html) ya know?).. and [Star Wars](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/17/star_wars_last_suppe.html).. and I gotta blog about [Love](http://nana.yanime.org/blog/2)... and I'm running out of [server diskspace](http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/)...   
  
I think there's some secret conspiracy to make so many things happen on my birthday week so as to discourage me in getting out of my room to celebrate. Grrrr!   
  
PS: Caught any hints yet?
