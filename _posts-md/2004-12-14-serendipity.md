How on earth does one get to [find solutions to problems of his field, borrowing techniques from a totally different world](http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,66005,00.html)? Get cross-trained in everything? Get double/triple degrees? Which other fields to "invest" in?

And of cos, the sharp-minded skeptic will see through my veiled attempt to qualify the much time I spend reading stuffs [totally unrelated to my immediate work](http://www.watchinggooglelikeahawk.com/) everyday. But, if one can be opportunistic about his chances in 4D/Toto, why not a little faith in how [20%-rule type of serendipity](http://www.google.com.sg/search?hl=en&q=%2220%25+time%22+google&meta=) can benefit?
