[This is really good stuff](http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/24/video-crockford-tjpl/). I'm floored by Video #3. Watch all of it. Don't skip. With the slides.

Proudly use your office hours to watch it. And tell your boss, "_You're welcome._"

PS: I feel like I just discovered the doormat I've been stepping on for years is actually a magic carpet...
