Went to Holland V on Sunday to makan with Love. And of cos, the primary objective is to try out the really kewl Segways!

Yeah. The authorities say its part of an effort to "[to introduce new technologies](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/149699/1/.html)".. (new? won't other ppl laugh and say its [a four-year-old product.](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000343027143/)?) And btw, didn't know that place is "one north".. i mean, north of where? Jurong Island? Anyways!.. the experience isn't at all thrilling as I'd hoped - I thought it would be Calvin and Hobbes kind of thrilling.. but not.  
  
First of all, there wasn't enough going around, and 1 demonstrator was nonchalantly riding it up and down the Holland V slope, talking on his handphone, perhaps to his girlfriend of watever, leaving only 2 more fella entertaining more passer bys. Up and down.. up and down he went...  
  
Then when its my turn, the fella was holding on to the Segway! I mean, the guy made me feel like I was..

Sheesh. Its a Segway buddy! If I can't really feel the balancing mechanism for myself, what's the different from standing on a stool? Even I gave much more leeway for Love when she was learning to cycle. Should've guessed that I won't be able to ride up and down anywhere based on the location they'd chosen to display the Segways. I thought they would've chosen some open area like those in front of nobody-goes-there-shops near the carpark...  
  
Grr!... and I did choose to have lunch at Holland V precisely to try Segway ya know?  
  
Anyways, had to fillup a survey after that. I'd rather wish they'd made me sign a "i shall not hold authorities any responsibilities" form and let me scooted around Holland V.
