Thanks to [Michael](http://vlogdir.com/) for the cool idea, RssFwd now supports the presence of enclosures in the emails. Layman: If you're subscribed to a feed that is also a podcast feed (e.g. [Pod-Father Adam Curry's feed](http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A//www.curry.com/xml/rss.xml)), you get Download links in the email for your convenience:

Do let me know if there's any problems.
