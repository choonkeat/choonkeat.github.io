> “There are 2 categories of flats in the Tiong Bahru Estate and these flats are split up into 2 sections within the Tiong Bahru Estate. <sup><a href="http://r0.sharedcopy.com/42rltdfd#shcp1">» link</a></sup>

> “The HDB Post War flats are rather angular and the shapes are very standardised. Some people always refer to it as the ones with the round balconies. <sup><a href="http://r0.sharedcopy.com/42rltdfd#shcp2">» link</a></sup>

> “These flats were built from the 1948 - 1951 period. It was built by the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT). Some people refer these flats as the LIM YEW HOCK flats but I do not think they are built during his reign as Chief Minister of Singapore as he only took office in 1956. <sup><a href="http://r0.sharedcopy.com/42rltdfd#shcp3">» link</a></sup>
