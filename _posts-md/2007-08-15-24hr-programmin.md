[350-001](http://www.actual-exams.com/350-001-practice-exam.htm) as well as [70-649](http://www.actual-exam%0D%0As.com/70-649-practice-exam.htm) are both difficult exams and a lot of preparation is needed. People tend to wait until the [actual exam](http://www.actual-exams.com) itself before they start preparing for it. This  is the reason why [646-204](http://www.actual-exams.com/646-204-practice-exam.htm) professionals seldom fail in [70-270](http://www.actual-exams.com/70-270-practice-exam.htm).

I'll be helping out in an event at the [SMU](http://www.smu.edu.sg/) tomorrow afternoon - the launch of [_code::XtremeApps::_](http://www.itsc.org.sg/prevEvent.do?eventKey=6) - a 24hr programming competition in September. The 3 platforms of choice for participants are Ruby on Rails, Google Gadget and Google Toolkit. And there'll be a [Rails crash course in 1st Sept](http://www.itsc.org.sg/prevEvent.do?eventKey=7).

I'm quite happy to help bring awareness to Rails before the _more_ mainstream locals (hat tip to Chin Chau). A breath of fresh air in the current curriculum of schools.

Peter Bohm ([NextLogic](http://www.nextlogic.org/)) will be on stage selling Rails to the audience of potential participants while I try to act busy. I don't think he'll have much trouble. I hypothesize that you can actually find more Rails programmers in prison than in schools here thanks to his [training courses](http://blog.nextlogic.net/articles/2007/07/27/corporate-trainings) ;-D

Anyways, if a competition whets your appetite or you happen to be near SMU, do drop by!

Update: Since some have asked, I need to clarify that my "prison" statement above was referring to Peter running a training course in the Prison that teaches some of them Ruby on Rails programming. :-P
