Damn good stunt from Scoble (but cannot pull this everyday)..

[Hey Ballmer or Gates, can I make an acquisition?](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/10/01.html#a11313)  

  
  
Whatever the outcome, he's gotten so many ppl guessing aloud ([example](http://web2.0central.com/archives/73)).. that the discussions would've generated sufficient research & ideas, including free public feedback poll to self-fulfil even if there weren't any target to start with.  
  
My guess is... [not 37signals](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/who_does_scoble_want_microsoft_to_buy.php) please.
