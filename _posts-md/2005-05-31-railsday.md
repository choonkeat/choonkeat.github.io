Finally thought of something to do for Railsday this Saturday!!:-D For the uninformed, Railsday is a day where teams(1 to 3)participate in a 24-hour hackathon to come up with some kewl Rails apps - checkout the [drool worthy prizes](http://railsday.com/prizes)! But I'd like to add, very straight-faced, that the greatest prize will be the opportunity to learn more Rails in 24 hours - more efficient than any self-disciplined project will give.

Since there are plenty more coders out there more familiar with this young framework (me the newbie am learning **so much** just by looking at [Typo blog](http://typo.leetsoft.com/) source code, so you know where I stand) I bet I can't win on "[Completeness, Code quality and UI](http://railsday.com/rules)" so I'll be hoping for the other areas like creativity and usefulness. Sadly colleagues whom have heard my idea says I'm delusionally excited. \*pooh\*

Nevertheless, I've gotten my hands on the latest (only) [Rails Bible](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/)hoping it'll ward off all evils. Smart guys these publishers.. Railsday coming up and they release their "beta e-book" for sale - so I'm suckered. But its good, 50 pages of selected reading and I think I can cut out 1/3 of my code in [Rssfwd](http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/).

And honestly, if I were back, working insmall independent software houses,creatingweb applicationsand hosting ([ASP model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_service_provider))for clients (e.g. ex-companies).. I'll definitely push to use Rails.

Because I'd want to be able to have dinner at home more often.
