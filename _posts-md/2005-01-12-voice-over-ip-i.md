Yes yes, I'm late.. but better than never. If you're still making expensive overseas call, but you and the other party is a [totally internet capable aunt y lilly](http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2005/01/your_ingterneck.html) then you should give your pocket a break and [download Skype now](http://www.skype.com/). If you, like me, had lousy experience with Internet Phone, MediaRing, blah blah toys long ago and am now just jaded about VOIP.. drop all that bad memories and just click install.  
  
And this is all for free. For $$ then you can even call your non-internet enabled aunty lilly.
