Perhaps the _whole-world-but-me_ already knows this... but I'd really never known I could refresh (Ctrl-R) directly at Firefox's View Source window!

Now that's quite a dandy [feature](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230693#c14)! Only found out just now when I'd accidentally refreshed the "wrong window" (so if you'd already known it, its only because you're clumsier than me. Tsk!)
