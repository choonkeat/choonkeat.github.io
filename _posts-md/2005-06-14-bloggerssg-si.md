Would've been nice if [Harry](http://www.sis.smu.edu.sg/Seminar/web2seminar.htm) could meet [Sally](http://tomorrow.sg/archives/2005/06/14/bloggerssg_2005_-_the_agenda.html). But it doesn't seem (from the agenda) that things will turn out so.  
  
Now such a booboo wouldn't have happened, had the gahmen really been part of [The Tomorrow.sg Conspiracy](http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2005/06/sgblogconspirac.html), aye?  
  
Anyways, all the best for the blogger con (at Woodlands leh... Michelle, you quickly start blogging and be in also la? if you scared, can bring "[deciferurs](http://deciferurs.blogspot.com/)", he's a veteran - can tell with such a chio online alias) I'll be missing it (in Vietnam) over the weekend, but will be at the SMU one tomorrow.. checking out if they'd finished the air-conditioning...
