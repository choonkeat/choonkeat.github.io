Some of you have asked for this since many moons ago. Finally plugged it [live](http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/publishers). Select and unselect at the [preview page](http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/preview?url=http://blog.yanime.org/xml/rss/feed.xml).. and watch the preview toggle between html and text.  
  
Its late. Shutting down..  
  
Btw, do you know that if you subscribe to the same feed with the same email, you won't be double-subscribed? Your original subscription will merely be updated. A new subscription won't be created.
