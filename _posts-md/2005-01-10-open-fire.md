Yep. The moment most Singaporean's have been waiting for... no, not the Robinson's Sale, but the opening record holder for the "first to kena" from [new IP laws inherited from US-FTA](http://www.newiplaws.org.sg/copyright.htm).

PS: Anyone knows the actual URL containing this image, let me know ah - This image isn't mine, so I don't like to be a bandwidth thef and anyhow [hotlink](http://wordworx.com/) to others.
