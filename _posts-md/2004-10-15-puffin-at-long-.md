 Independent HTTP server running at port 4664  
Background caching - it says "one-time indexing in progress".. One-time?? I hope it does updates as well, pls don't disappoint me..  
Search speed - fast thus far, hey its just installed  
Result presentation - exactly like their web search  
  
For those of you in companies where you can't install stuff into your PC because the IS department blah blah, demand this - cite productivity as ur reason. This thing searches (with option to exclude) :

- Outlook email
- Outlook Express email
- AOL IM   
- Word
- Excel
- PowerPoint
- Text and other (i hope it index files without extensions as well, my Copernic can't)  
- Web history
- Include secure pages (HTTPS) in web history
Life is good.
