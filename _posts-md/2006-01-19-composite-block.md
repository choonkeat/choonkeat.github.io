Anyone knows how [CBL](http://cbl.abuseat.org/) works? Its funny they provide so much information on their site, but nothing concrete. Perhaps they should just tell me **WHY** an ip address is listed **BEFORE** presenting their reels of text educating what you must, must not, need, need not, could, could not, am, am not, doing, done, did not,... watever!

I mean since its not about spam or open relays, ip addresses listed on CBL probably has no intention to be on it (read: victim). So what's with the secrecy?

Apologies to some RssFwd users whom are not receiving their daily feeds. Most probably your mail server is rejecting:

> 550-Message rejected because [yanime.at.spry.com](http://yanime.at.spry.com/) [[66.249.1.208](http://66.249.1.208/)] is  
> 550-blacklisted at [cbl.abuseat.org](http://cbl.abuseat.org/) see Blocked - see  
> 550 [http://cbl.abuseat.org/lookup.cgi?ip=66.249.1.208](http://cbl.abuseat.org/lookup.cgi?ip=66.249.1.208)

Any enlightenment is appreciated.
