Was looking around for an isometric chat engine (using flash, specifically).. and am quite perturb that isn't any serious projects that is [freely](http://www.gnu.org/) available. How sad.. to think that one has to create his or her own isometric thingy -from scratch - everytime there's a need to use it?   
  
Anyways.. got my lazy butt off to doing a scratch bit.. if anyone's interested, see if my program ([download Y-Anime](http://www.yanime.org/y-anime.zip)) would be a useful kick start.. Hopefully I'll get around improving it often. You can preview [here](http://www.yanime.org/y-anime.swf).  
  
Its late and I'm famished!!!
