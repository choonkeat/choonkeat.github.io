Since my job posting is mysteriously not appearing on joelonsoftware job board, I thought I might as well post them here. So if you know of anyone who might be interested in this, please forward this entry to them - thanks lots!

**1. Affle**

What does Affle do? **MY** description would be: The current flagship product, SMS2, is _basically Adsense for SMS - but mostly content (rss, headlines, e.g.) instead of ads._ i.e. relevant, non-intrusive. You can read in more detail [here](http://sms2.sg/).

Care deeply about algorithms, protocols, huge data sets, web2.0, user experience or Friday pizza? Then you'll be in good company. Apply [here](http://www.affle.co.uk/jobs/join-us/join-us.html). The tech hq is [here](http://www.streetdirectory.com/asia_travel/travel/travel_id_138/travel_site_3096/) in Singapore.

**2. SharedCopy**

What was once [a proof of concept](http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2007/03/as-easy-as-pass.html) is now [my fulltime project](http://sharedcopy.com/) - how's that for work and play? [This nifty little tool](http://flash.screeniac.com/sharedcopy/sharedcopy.html?TB_iframe=true&height=590&width=1050) let's anyone with a browser to write on any webpage - and share it easily.

Young project with lots of ideas to explore and expand. If this gets your coding fingers dancing already, drop me an email - choonkeat at gmail.com - this project needs you!
