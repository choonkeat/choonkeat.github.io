Did many quiet updates to RssFwd itself lately, hope nothing breaks - its been a few weeks already so I guess not.

 

Most obvious is the update to the footer of the email template, as well as making clustered emails work even better _(I can't seem to dig up who suggested this update - whoever it was, sorry its taken this long. Thanks for the suggestions!)_ :

Also, [auto-discovery](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/06/02/important_change_to_the_link_tag) of web pages with multiple feeds [work better now](http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogcritics.org%2Farchives%2F2007%2F01%2F02%2F174358.php).

Happy New Year!

Update: And oh ya, a long-time wishlist: doesn't choke on [xml:base](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/) now... meaning links in [some Atom feeds](http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tbray.org%2Fongoing%2F) should be properly unravelled hence.
