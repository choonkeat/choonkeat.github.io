Very interesting. Its a "Strategy-cast" by [Adam "Father of Podcast" Curry](http://images.google.com/images?q=Adam+Curry) and Ron Bloom.   
  
Listen to [this mp3](http://homepage.mac.com/dailysourcecode/DSC/Podshow20.mp3) [mp3 download, hopefully those-whom-we-don't-speak-of don't think u're pirating anything..]   
  
Sorry if the mp3 is very lengthy.. but I think its worthy. Split it into smaller mp3s if you want ([this is what i use](http://mp3splt.sourceforge.net/), but a very unfriendly user interface).. its a very kewl sneak peek at the creation of an industry... Hey, how many times can one witness that in a lifetime? Enjoy.   
  
Note: the first few minutes are them talking of their history and background, the actual podcast topic starts around the 17th minute.
