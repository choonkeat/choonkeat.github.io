And sorry to torrent folks have to give way for regular folks like me reading text. Besides, I'm sure if [Gmail is only used to store-and-find torrent seeds](http://s90215429.onlinehome.us/sjvilla79/blog/2005/07/using-gmail-to-find-downloads-on.html), you guys can be gracious enough to give more resources to fellow subscribers with simpler needs of keeping track on [Slashdot](http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Findex.rss), [The Scobleizer](http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A//radio.weblogs.com/0001011/rss.xml), [Boing Boing](http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A//feeds.feedburner.com/boingboing/iBag), [Tomorrow.sg](http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A//tomorrow.sg/) and the like.
