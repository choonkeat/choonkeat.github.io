Its funny how things are business-as-usual, then suddenly I'm 17GB over my 50GB monthly quota and its just half a month! Wierd. So I've migrated to an unmetered hosting plan.

If anything breaks on [RssFwd](http://www.rssfwd.com/), lemme know - my email is choonkeat at gmail.

For those interested in the source codes, coincidentally, RssFwd source code has migrated to use [Rubyforge](http://rubyforge.org/)'s "_new_" SVN hosting yesterday as well. No [Trac](http://www.edgewall.com/trac/) yet though.
