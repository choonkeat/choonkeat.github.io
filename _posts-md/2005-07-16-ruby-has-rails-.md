Don't ask me how to pronounce it. Ask the British :-P at [djangoproject.com](http://www.djangoproject.com/). A quick look through the docs and stuff (no 10 minute video -sulk-) seems to show that this framework gets it as well. Some differences of cos (some would argue big differences), but generally its heart warming to see the trend of framework-works-for-developer (rather than developer-works-for-framework) picks up... aka "[Web 3.0 Frameworks](http://www.jrandolph.com/blog/?p=8)".   
  
I hope Rails learns to play with Django and they'll not smite each other (if not friends, don't be enemies). The world is big enough. A combined message from different camps will be more resounding [than any one camp trying to say he is the bestest](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=35202) - and coming off as naive or clueless.
