Ah.. nothing like reading a piece of entertaining and enlightening article in the morning. For all the [lawsuits](http://www.google.com/search?q=sco+suit+linux), FAQs about "_...can I take open source and sell as proprietary.._ ", all the [many many open source licenses](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/index.php) with different ifs-then-elses.. somebody too tired has [a nice closing note that gives a clear view of what derived works is](http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/01/msg00582.html). (non-techies: dive to the paragrah beginning with "As I was politely asked...")
