"_Translate from [what] language to [what] language_"

How odd. I go to any translation service, and that's what they'll ask me. More often than not, when I need a translation, I don't even know what language it is. Seriously, I really can't tell Portuguese from Spanish.

Here's a tool I wrote to help myself: [try-anslator](http://dev.choonkeat.com/js/lang/index).

It uses [Xerox's Language Guesser](http://www.xrce.xerox.com/competencies/content-analysis/tools/guesser-ISO-8859-1.en.html) together with [Google Language tool](http://www.google.com.sg/language_tools?hl=en). (First choice [Babelfish](http://babelfish.altavista.com/) went out of their way to stop programmers like me, so I stopped)

Its not the best translation in the world, but at least it gives me a good feel of what the text is talking about.. plus I see what language it was. Be gentle now, I'm not running on a dedicated machine.
