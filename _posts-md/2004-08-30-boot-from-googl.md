Wow. And I was worried some low-life ISV will custom some mail-application and secretly use Gmail as backend and continue $$elling email-hosting services to ignorant corporate folks... now someone has made a [filesystem on gmail](http://richard.jones.name/google-hacks/gmail-filesystem/gmail-filesystem.html)!! Now there's no need to even custom a mail application... some people just has too much time on their hands!! (jealous)  
  
What next? Google-CPU? Booting up Internet, anyone?
