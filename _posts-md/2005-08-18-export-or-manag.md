You'll notice your RssFwd emails now come with an extra footer. At last, you can now retrieve a list of what you've subscribed to in RssFwd.

The data is in [OPML](http://www.opml.org/spec) format, styled by [XSLT](http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt) into a usable web page. Let me know your feedback.

PS: In the meantime, StupidGenius [has done some nice Ajax tricks](http://blog.stupidgenius.org/articles/2005/08/17/rssfwd) [click on the rssfwd icon on his side bar] to create a drop-down box for subscription on his blog. Hopefully we can extract a clean version for content publishers to use easily.
