A small, agile Singapore-based company that I know of has just started using [Basecamp](http://www.basecamphq.com/) to manage 2 of their latest, biggest projects. Their technical lead is also checking out Ruby and more importantly, [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/). This is a company doing their projects with [Java on LAMP](http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2005/06/14/wrong-fight). Perfect fit.  
  
I know pockets of companies has been [picking up Rails developers](http://www.google.com/search?q=hiring+rails+developers).. But this has been of the closest proximity thus far (not they're not hiring Rails developers, yet). But its right here. An actual company. I am not alone.  
  
I'm really holding my breath for things to work out...
