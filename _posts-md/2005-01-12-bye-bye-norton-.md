See la, Norton, never should you forget to pay your protection money.. now turf owner comes up with his [own roti prata](http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.mspx) and even promises free weekly update liao la! So now an oily-hand's options are: "If don't use pirated windows, then can don't use pirated Norton", or "Continue to use pirated windows, and pay licensed Norton"?, or "Continue to use pirated windows and Norton, and Dreamweaver and everything else in the meantime". Me thinks #1 and #3 more likely.  
  
Anyways, along with more pleasant news.. at the [current rate](http://www.apple.com/macmini/), [#11 on my todo](http://www.43things.com/people/view/choonkeat) may just be coming true soon..
