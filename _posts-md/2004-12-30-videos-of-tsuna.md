In some sick pun, the best way to fetch amateur videos of first-person encounters of the tsunami is via a [torrent](http://bittorrent.com/) from [this download link](http://www.downhillbattle.org/labs/battletorrent/demo/btdownload.php?type=torrent&file=TsunamiTorrentV1.zip.torrent) [[blog](http://www.punditguy.com/2004/12/horror.html)]. Hope the MPAA don't [sue](http://www.google.com/search?q=mpaa+sue+bittorrent) it offline.
