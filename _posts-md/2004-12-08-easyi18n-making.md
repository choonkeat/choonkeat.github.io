Many moons have passed after [my grunt on the tedious-ness of writing i18n codes](/articles/2004/05/11/i18n-aka-internationalisation). Now, at least I have 10% started - EasyI18N. Ok, lame name.. but at least its to the point. [[download source codes](http://www.yanime.org/easyi18n.zip)]  
  
I've decided to split into a 2-part effort. 1) Parse the source tree and churn out an XML report of line numbers, file names, etc. 2) Parse the XML report and provide GUI to do the real work for I18N.The idea is to have user-experience like that of a spell-checker on a modern word processer, prompted, guided, clear, easy.  
  
Let's see how things go.
