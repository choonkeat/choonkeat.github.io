 **Update March 18, 05** : "_Its T-T-True (tm)!_" [We'll really see ZOIDS](http://www.plustech.fi/Walking1.html)! Now if they'd only be shooting some [rockets](http://images.google.com/images?q=quake%20rocket)!

[By Nasa](http://www.wired.com/news/space/0,2697,66804,00.html). I hope they'll get inspiration from the older generation models though.. those I see in Toys R' Us are [too unelegantly flashy](http://images.google.com/images?q=zoids) and no where close to mineeeeeeee..   
  
Ah, its late.. gotta sleep.
