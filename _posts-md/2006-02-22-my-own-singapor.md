Ok ok... maybe there are [others](http://www.adrianlee.info/?p=55) with the [same needs](../../../../articles/2005/03/01/new-media-consumption-habits) as well. Here are my unofficial, hand-rolled feeds: [Channelnewsasia RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/MyChannelNewsAsia-Headlines), [HDB RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/MyHdbPressReleases).

 

The links goes back to the respective sites for full content. I find it more useful when used together with Gmail Web Clips, rather than with RssFwd or Firefox Livebookmarks..

 

> Settings \> Web Clips \> Search by topic or URL   
> Enter "feeds.feedburner.com/MyChannelNewsAsia-Headlines"  
> Click "Add"

Hmm.. I think I need one for Esplanade as well.  
 Update: Unofficial feed for [Esplanade](http://feeds.feedburner.com/MyEsplanade)
