[Great](http://writely.blogspot.com/2006/03/google-yep-google.html). Now I feel more safe putting my docs in [Writely](http://www.writely.com/), knowing that they won't _be going away_ anytime soon.

I'm hoping they don't get too stuck on the whole social / collaboration / web2.0 thingy... Just give me **1 URL to create a new "Untitled" document**. I can bookmark that URL and hence, with 1-click I can create a new 'Word' document.

Briefly tried to do it just now, but there's too much javascript hoops to jump as a 3rd party to implement the simple feature.

I don't know about you, but I _always_ have my browser running. So this will be a big deal. And maybe one day, I really won't need to use notepad.exe for scribbling anymore... 1-click.  
  
(assuming I can sign on persistently, gmail style)

So,... Yahoo's gonna buy [JotLive](http://www.jotlive.com/)?

Update: Ahh... appears to come true. 2 months later today: [Rumor: Yahoo Acquired Jotspot](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/05/10/rumor-yahoo-closed-jotspot-acquisition/%20) [JotLive == JotSpot Live == JotSpot's product]
