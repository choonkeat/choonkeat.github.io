Of cos I'd like to think my listener-ship mattered that much. Just a few days I never tune in then [Morning Express](http://class95.mediacorpradio.com/classmdt.htm) (arguably [the best morning radio show in Singapore](http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/1997/09/sne_part_1.html)) closing shop liao? If you're a believer in petitions, perhaps [this can help](http://thiscause.org/p/menu.php?p=Too85949DB).
