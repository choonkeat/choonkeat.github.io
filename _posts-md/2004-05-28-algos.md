I do [like](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4960) [LOAF](http://loaf.cantbedone.org/).. it has a very interesting idea of using Bloom Filters to sort importance of email (extendable to resolve spam?). Something about it just nags me that there's a bigger use for it.. Do check it out!  
  
The BSP-tree was also brought to fame by [John Carmack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack)'s DOOM engine. TODO list, "Must get hands on kewl algos and make them famous too"
