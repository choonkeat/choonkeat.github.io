My friend used to kid that it would be awesome to see illegal hawkers selling pirated CDs of your software product - 'cos it would mean your product has arrived.  
  
Now perhaps, we can use cleaner benchmark - [be a Jeopardy answer](http://blakeross.com/index.php?p=134). Gratz Firefox!  
  
PS: Hmm.. but considering Jeopardy is for smarty pants, i.e. obscure Q&A, appearing there may mean your product is obscure? Aim for [PSC night](http://ch8.mediacorptv.com/shows/variety/view/502/1/.html) perhaps..
