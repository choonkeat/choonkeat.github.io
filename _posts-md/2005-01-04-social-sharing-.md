First, I found [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) (check my puny attempt at [posting pictures on the left](http://blog.yanime.org/)) and their [refreshing way of using keywords](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags) to build interest groups.. Now, (ok, i didn't know who started first!) I find [43things](http://www.43things.com/home/), with the same idea to push out TODO list! Its so kewl [I'm so doing it now](http://www.43things.com/people/view/choonkeat)! Of cos, girls can probably mutate it to do shopping lists as well..   
  
Sidenote: I think the app can be much improved by not solely relying on exact phrase matching. A good alternative without the need to create a implicit-dictionary-guessing engine for grouping of different phrases would be to [reduce the chance of different phrases being created in the first place](/articles/2004/05/11/feedback-and-faq). Less technical, more about user experience.  
  
Building interest groups organicly, via serendipity. No opt-in, no he-is-my-friend, no manual creation of groups - but in the words of [Moulin Rouge](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203009/), 'Come what may'. I'm building my TODO list, the crux isn't about having people share my TODO actions, but if there are people of common goals, all the better!  
  
I love this concept. Its so refreshing.. it begs for an even better, revolutionary use of it..
