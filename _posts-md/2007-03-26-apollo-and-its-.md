In case you've been living under a rock (_like me with over 1k unread feed items_), the recent buzz in Web tech has been around [Adobe's Apollo runtime platform](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/videos/apollo_demo07/index.html), and [Joyent's Slingshot](http://joyeur.com/2007/03/22/joyent-slingshot). Now that I've watched both videos, and read Joyent's own post (instead of 3rd party reporting), I'm very pleased to observe the first steps towards [realisation of vision](http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2005/12/browser-based-a.html) (more with regards to Slingshot):

A Rails VM! That comes complete with its own browser and desktop events (e.g. drag-drop). What a clever, clean way of doing Browser-Based Application! Kudos to the pretty package. Crossing my fingers that it'll live up to its expectation, and that _client installation of Slingshot is totally seamless_.

 

If the consistency in Rails directory layout and library arrangement can breed Slingshot et al... I can't wait to see what Rails RESTfulness will lead to.
