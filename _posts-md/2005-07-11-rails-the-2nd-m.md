Rails has released an updated video (see previous video [here](http://media.nextangle.com/rails/rails_setup.mov)), originally prepared for a conference presentation. So the audio you hear is actually from the presenter trying to catch up with what David is typing in his silent movie.  
  
All web developers should view it: [HERE](http://www.rubyonrails.org/media/video/rails_take2_with_sound.mov) (15 minutes video). And maybe we should run a quiz for watching the video clip like: How many things can you spot him not being required to do?

"aiyah..I deen install quick time"  
"install. its fucking worth it."  

  
  
I hope nay sayers realise, its time to say goodbye to some "commodity" practices. Its been, what 10 over years? of web development.. isn't it time to move on? Why are we still haggling over trivial design decisions like foreign key naming?  
  
Time to leave such stuff to the framework. And move on.
