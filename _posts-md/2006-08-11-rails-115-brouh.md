So much [noise](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/8/9/rails-1-1-5-mandatory-security-patch-and-other-tidbits). So much [debates](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/8/10/security-update-rails-1-0-not-affected). Only [1 productive comment](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/8/10/security-update-rails-1-0-not-affected#comment-11106) in the sea of words.

The whole brouhaha reminded me of an incident (not programming related) where a friend of mine told another friend specifically NOT to do something. Of cos, quite a lot of hell broke loose.

Oh well...
