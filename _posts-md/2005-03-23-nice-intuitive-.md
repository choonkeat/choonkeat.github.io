Found this drop-down box in [NowPublic](http://www.nowpublic.com/)'s sign-up page.

Instead of the usual, more technical, "_country_:+_0X00_hrs" dropdown box, this one basically state the "current time" in each timezone, and you just have to choose the "current time" that matches yours! Sweet.

And also, your users from smaller countries won't feel left out.
