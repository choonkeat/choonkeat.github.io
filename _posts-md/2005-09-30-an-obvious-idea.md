About a month old article, but I realise quite a few of us haven't seen it yet: [Online Gambling: Buy a Bot to play for you](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.09/pokerbots.html?tw=wn_tophead_7)

> For $200, you can buy the full package: a one-year subscription to the team edition, which includes the autoplaying bot and a card-sharing module that allows multiple players to communicate during a game. Bornert won't say how many customers he has; he'll admit only that he makes a living selling WinHoldEm  
> [emphasis mine]

  
Now ethics aside, I'd say that's a brilliant idea! Getting a computer to gamble for you only lets you play in a methodical, steady manner while you sleep at night and wake up a few bucks richer.. but Team mode just puts you one up against the dealer! As YP says, FOOK!  
  
[Grok](http://www.fantasmal.com/blog/) said before he's quite inspired by [Bram Cohen](http://www.bittorrent.com/donate.html)'s success story... I'd say this one is quite inspiring as well :-D   
  
Quick! Now think of an evil but obvious-idea! Oh no! I can't come up with any! My head's full of gambling bot now.. and about why i didn't come up with Team mode - arghh...  
  
On other stuff, Adam Bosworth gives a good talk on how software should be designed and developed evolved: [Intelligent Reaction](http://salesforce.breezecentral.com/intelligentreaction/). Good stuff!   
  
Been busy with something of late, will lift the curtain soon :-)
