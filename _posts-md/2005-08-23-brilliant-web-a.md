I'm no expert in calendar applications, but I'm very tempted to say, this must be the most brilliant web-based calendar I've seen: [Hula web interface](http://nat.org/2005/august/hula.html). Drag-drop date/time, duration, faded borders, in-place editing.. brilliant!  
  
[Hula Project](http://hula-project.org/Hula_Server), btw, is

> a calendar and mail server whose goal is to be fun and easy to use, while scaling effortlessly from small groups to large organizations with thousands of members.
