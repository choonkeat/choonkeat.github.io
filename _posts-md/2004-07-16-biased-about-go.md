Tried out [Picasa](http://www.picasa.com/google/?promo=hpp2) and think its really kewl.. but Love says I'm biased because its from Google.. Am I? So I asked my ex-colleague, the reputed designer.. YP.

> +YP+Lavito~: king le.. this software...  
> +YP+Lavito~: apple's iphoto lose..  
> +YP+Lavito~: for print one ...iphoto one more "designer"  
> +YP+Lavito~: foook...export album to webpage.  
> +YP+Lavito~: adobe album can eat grass liao..
