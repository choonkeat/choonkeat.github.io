After showing [SharedCopy](http://sharedcopy.com/) to some people at the [Geekout](http://www.thedigitalmovement.org/blog/2007/03/13/nexus-2007-come-geekout-with-us/), Vu Xuan Linh pointed me to [the Web Marker](http://liveurls.mozdev.org/installation.html) firefox extension. My first thought was, argh... feature rat race...

But after installing and seeing how the extension works, I'm happy to say that [the two can co-exist](http://www.google.com.sg.sharedcopy.com/a5a2c1842a62ca1276435f1de60c1aa5.html) quite happily. What other tools are out there that could be complimentary to the service?

Progress update:

- Bookmarklet is working on IE6
- Comments can be dragged around now ([Moo.fx](http://moofx.mad4milk.net/))
- Public read-only mode
- Copies are version controlled
