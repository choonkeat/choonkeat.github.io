I'll be out of action for the next 24 days. I don't foresee any disruptions to the rssfwd service.. (I've cleared much diskspace).. but if there is, my very sincere apologies :-( I'll try to check mails whenever I can.

Anyways, give [GreaseMonkey on IE](http://www.daishar.com/blog/archives/2005/03/greasemonkey_fo.html) [[updated download](http://www.daishar.com/blog/archives/2005/03/greasemonkie_up_1.html)] a try.. (super alpha, doesn't even install on mine well.. ). I hope [GreaseMonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/) scripts will become the defacto 'cross browser plugin' platform, and gets built into browsers directly. Oh well.. time to leave my brains at home...

And I predict it'll be a DAMN beautiful day on 29th April...
