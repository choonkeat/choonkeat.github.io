Our graphic designer Luke was somewhat doubtful, but we thought it would be a cool feature, so we dove in.[<sup>link »</sup>](http://r7.sharedcopy.com/5d22ufcr#shcp1)

Reminds me of something that [Genometri](http://www.genopal.com) presented at [Geekout](http://nexus2007.wikispaces.com/Geekout) recently. [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory) will be an interesting endeavor for color-challenged people like me.
