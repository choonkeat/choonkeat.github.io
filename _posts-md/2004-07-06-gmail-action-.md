1. WINMAIL.DAT  
  
There are 2 kinds of reaction after reading this first title point. One is "what's that geeky you?"; The other is "hmmmm.. ?" with a smile forming at the corner of the mouth.. Yes, for those 2nd types.. Gmail handles the irky [winmail.dat](http://www.google.com/search?q=winmail.dat) attachment for you - it just works. For those first types.. you've been causing way too much dismay to those 2nd types.. now go apologise to anyone you notice to be smiling more these days..  
  
Oops.. today only got 1.. back to work!
