Poor [Third Voice, Inc](http://web.archive.org/web/19991013034242/http://thirdvoice.com/) was way ahead of its time... (which is [often not good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton)) now only remembered as "[bright ideas that never caught on](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/11/five_years_ago/)". There's recently been a revival / rehash of the website-overlay-comments idea. First, with [Newsmasher greasemonkey script](http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2005/03/28/newsmashing-aka-3rd-voice-redux), now with [http://hoodwink.d/](http://hoodwink.d/) [this link won't work for you? read on]  
  
I was pretty puzzled at Hoodwink'd actually - host not found, etc -... only later did I realized I'd missed the all important first post: [Hoodwink'd, Day One: Forcing the Host to Attend the Party](http://redhanded.hobix.com/-h/hoodwinkDDayOneForcingTheHostToAttendTheParty.html). The cool factor is there.. including the website footer saying "[this site was probably designed by 37 signals or the like](http://feeds.feedburner.com/projectionist?m=102)"... one thing bugs me.  
  
I didn't have bandwidth (nor dream) to host a world of comments, Newsmasher (term was coined by [Paul Boutin](http://slate.msn.com/id/2114791/)) merely piggyback'd on the hosting and community of [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) - and in order not to abuse delicious, Newsmasher would only display "comments" after clicking on the \<c... /\> overlay, and not load on every page you view.  
  
Hoodwink'd however, seems to be doing that - isn't that single-point-of-failure thing what made 3rd Voice a pain to use? Hopefully [Why The Lucky Stiff](http://redhanded.hobix.com/) has a distributed system planned...   
  
PS: Yah, I haven't updated Newsmasher with delicious's new (months old) template
