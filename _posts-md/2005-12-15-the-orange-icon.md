Good news. [Microsoft and Mozilla shake hands](http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/archive/2005/12/14/503778.aspx): Firefox's orange feed icon [[example](http://sean.members.winisp.net/posts/icons/feed-icon32x32.png)] will be the standard icon used.   
  
Now for all sites carrying RSS feeds, its time to [carry the auto-discovery link](http://www.askdavetaylor.com/how_do_i_set_up_my_blog_for_rss_autodiscovery.html). Modern applications would immediately know what to do - e.g. showing The Orange Icon on your behalf, and provide subscription options automatically without you having [to spend a full page teaching people how to](http://www.nokia-asia.com/nokia/0,,85275,00.html) (and that's assuming readers know wtf is rss for.. ).

Sites that carry feeds without the auto-discovery link might just as well do hyperlinks without actually hyperlinking them, e.g. go to http://www.google.com/ - then they can add a page of instructions teaching people to highlight, copy-and-paste into their location bar, press enter...

Now wouldn't this be better? Firefox gives you a 'Add Live Bookmark' option, what will IE7 bring? What will new applications give? You'll never know what disservice you're doing to your readers.
