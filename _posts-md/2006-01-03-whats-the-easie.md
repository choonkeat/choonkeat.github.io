The equivalent question several years ago was, "_What was the easiest way to learn and write HTML?_"

How do you display tables in a web page? Go to a page with tables, view-source and write the same. Alternatively, if its too tiring to surf the web for the feature you want to copy, just fire-up FrontPage or DreamWeaver (blasphemy!), create what you want (e.g. an image map) and view source. Tada!

Now, what's the easiest way to learn Ajax? e.g. the [google suggest-ish auto-complete](http://demo.script.aculo.us/ajax/autocompleter).

Simple as 1 2 3,

1. Do it in Rails once: [3 steps demo (.mov file)](http://mir.aculo.us/images/autocomplete1.mov) or [O'Reilly tutorial](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/06/09/rails_ajax.html)   
2. Copy the HTML (view-source), the javascript files (yes, the ajax javascripts are MIT licensed, aka you can do anything you want) and   
3. Re-implement the server-side yourself (this is the familiar part for most).

And of cos, arm yourself with some [Ajax Debugging](http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000252.html) facility _just in case_.

Examples are plenty: [Drag-drop shopping cart](http://demo.script.aculo.us/shop), [Drag-drop list](http://demo.script.aculo.us/ajax/sortable_elements), [Upload progressbar](http://sean.treadway.info/demo/upload/), and many more
