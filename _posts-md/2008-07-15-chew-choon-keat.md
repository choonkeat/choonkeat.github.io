![](/images/old/profile.jpg)loves programming and has been doing that professionally for over 10 years - moving from C, Perl, Java to Ruby & Javascript. Choon Keat is curious about everything and is always thinking of ways to improve [his] life with better design, better software. Sometimes, he even [blogs](http://blog.choonkeat.com/)about these things.

Choon Keat is practical, delivers simple solution and executes iteratively. He has been practicing that on a startup he has founded, [SharedCopy](http://sharedcopy.com).

## Professional summary

Choon Keat finds himself involved in startups most of the time. But he did once venture into a mid-size J2EE shop to find out what enterprise software was about.

His hands-onexperience range from (server-side) administrating Linux boxes, writing web apps & integration with SMSC, MMSC & Jabber, to (client-side) writing Eclipse plugins, Javascript, Flash ActionScript, to programming on various other devices like phones and the TV.

His recent work revolves around email, Ruby, Rails and a lot of Javascript.

## Software passion

Choon Keat loves open source. He gives back by submitting patches to the [Rails project](http://www.rubyonrails.com) and releasing his own software as open source: [hquery](http://github.com/choonkeat/hquery/tree/master), [oauth4r](http://code.google.com/p/oauth4r), [poormans-trends](http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2008/04/poor-mans-trend.html), [krjs](http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2006/06/krjs-rjs-withou.html),[web\_sg\_form\_builder](http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2007/04/now-ive-finally.html),[hpricot\_forms](http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2006/07/hpricotforms.html), [rssfwd](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rssfwd).

Occasionally, the need to share overflows and he turns them into talks for geek audience: [Sharing session for PHP User Group](http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2008/04/ruby-on-rails-.html), [OAuth for Singapore RubyBrigade](http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2007/11/singapore-rb-me.html), and [Rails boot camp 1](http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2006/03/notes-from-rail.html)and [Rails boot camp 2](http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2007/08/24hr-programmin.html).

Choon Keat understands that experiments are a large part of learning. Hence he'lloccasionallydeployexperiments like [Real [Twitter] Friends](http://real-friends.choonkeat.com/), [Rss Paper for iPhone](http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2009/04/an-iphone-optimized-web-page.html), [Timezone UI](http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2008/03/a-clearer-layou.html) & [Translation UI](http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2008/03/tryanslator2.html) just to see how well they work.

## What he's working on now

[Trying to convince](http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2015/10/file-uploads-2015.html) others to employ [a image server](https://attache-demo.herokuapp.com/) to handle file uploads, instead of simply reaching for the most fashionable gem.
