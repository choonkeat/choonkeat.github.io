[BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/28/web_based_apple_2_em.html) has a link to a [site allowing you to run Apple II emulator on your browser](http://www.virtualapple.com/)! (Windows + IE only). It has decks of programs, the originals! It even has my long-lost game... I'd missed so much... playing at my brother's friend's house,.. 8 person cramming for controls on 1 keyboard.... multi-player the old fashion way.... [Dogfight](http://www.virtualapple.com/dogfightdisk.html)! Just spent the last half-hour re-discovering the keys and dog fighting! Checkout the silly parachutes when the planes are shot! KAWAYI NEH! Ultimate nostalgia!  
  
Of cos, kids will probably [think its super lame](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/28/smartass_kids_slammi.html). But they don't know do they?
