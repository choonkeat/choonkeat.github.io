Finally got around to fix the Rssfwd bookmarklet (wasn't working on Internet Explorer). Now it does, and also tested on Firefox and Opera 8.  
  
Also, I've added a tiny rssfwd icon/link thing to make [site owner's](http://blog.uwinnipeg.ca/schwagbag/archives/2005/05/post_1.html) [lives easier](http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/archives/2005/05/17/cool_shifted_scsu_services.html).. no more hoops to jump to make your site subscribe-able. Just include a little picture like this:

Also.. fixed a big stupid bug. I didn't know feed detection failed on XHTML compliant websites. Duh. Things should just work now. Lemme know if anything thing doesn't.  
  
Also.. I just found some enterprising folks [using Rssfwd to push content to their site](http://starting-a-businessx.blogspot.com/2005/04/bringing-back-nfl-could-be-bargain-for.html). Heh. I'm still undecided whether that's a good thing or bad thing. I guess good.  
  
PS: Not done with my pick-a-VPS-hosting-plan yet. This is taking much longer than I thought.
