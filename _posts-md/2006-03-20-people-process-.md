I'll leave the point-by-point rebuttal to [other](http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000577.html) [people](http://www.redmonk.com/cote/archives/2006/03/mcgovern_comes.html)... but do have an issue with [James McGovern](http://duckdown.blogspot.com/2006/03/more-thoughts-on-ruby-and-why-it-isnt.html)'s claim over #9.

Now that's quite the priority that you'd want to be seen as believing in, ain't it? He's championing for Enterprise Architecture, so I must guess he means to say that's the priority enterprises practise.

Interesting.

From the planet that I live in, outsourcing trends is on the rise and expensive software are sold to (and bought by) enterprises. Enterprise software projects are usually built with a _few good men_ as leads, and a farm of programmers. Why outsource your first priority? If something is of last priority, why buy the most expensive? Hence, **say it like it is** , the following priority may reflect what's out there: Tools and Process, **then** People.

And maybe, if one day... "people" does get prioritized higher... they'd be allowed to [pick their own tools](http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html).
