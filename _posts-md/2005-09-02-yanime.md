Its funny how one thing lead to another.. I might just be re-igniting the development of my flash chat engine - which happens to be (surprise) the source of my domain name: yanime: yet another isometric engine. I'd started it, and it went on hold, collecting dust while my then-new job took be into a roller coaster project. During that period, I found Rails.  
  
Anyways, yanime is GPL open sourced.. just gotta figure out how to. I check-in the .FLA? Until then, you can see the current reference implementation: [here](http://blog.yanime.org/yanime/sampleui.html). Oh ya, its raw but its pluggable and XML based.
