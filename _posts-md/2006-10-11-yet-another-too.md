Nice interface - it looks vaguely familiar actually. I wonder if [Coghead](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/11/coghead-goes-live-build-applications-visually/) intend to woo the enterprise crowd and do a _Save-as BPEL_ ;-)

If a developer using a Coghead application can switch (with a click on a [bookmarklet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet), and authentication) into inspect/debugging mode on the current application's current page that could be swell.
