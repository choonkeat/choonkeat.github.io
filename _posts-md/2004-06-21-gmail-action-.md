For you faithful googlers and, more precisely, gmail new-loves..   
  
**1. GTray**  
  
Shows 'You have XYZ new email at Gmail" thingy on the bottom right of ur Win2k machine..

Note: When keying in your 'Username', omit the '@gmail.com'...   
Note: Since no source is distributed with it, can't promise its non-spyware.. but its kewl for now. Keep me updated if this changes.  
  
**2. Use Gmail as Bug/Issue Tracking System**  
  
This one, suggested by my good friend Kiansheng, whom has evolved from using ICQ logs to track issues (really, that's his main criteria for selection which IM client to use)

> created labels 'Unresolved', 'In Progress' and 'Resolved' and send  
> memos to myself.. gmail neatly apply labels to the entire conversation  
> instead of individual entries...  
>   
> of coz it doesn't have a autogenerate bug # and other things like  
> priority, etc.. but that's enuf of a mobile bugzilla for me... :)

  
Any more bright ideas? Do fill me in :-D
