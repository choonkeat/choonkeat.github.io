Something interesting at sgBlog today, a [Games Developing seminar](http://www.sgblog.com/component/option,com_simpleboard/Itemid,0/func,view/id,181/catid,12/) at NUS on this Friday. What's more interesting, is the find of a game named [Immortals](http://www.envisagereality.com./) ... quite pretty I think, though my friend commented but this kind of game is outdated le.. now is lan game.. he's the DOTA kind of guy. Anyhoo, go watched the pretty game trailer.. done by some impressive people in their own right, e.g. [Shawn Ye](http://www.shawnye.com/) and [Dominic Qwek](http://www.dominicqwek.com/)
