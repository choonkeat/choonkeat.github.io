I'm using [RssFwd](http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/) to subscribe to all my many news/blog/kewl feeds, and [receiving them in my Gmail](http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd_email.PNG) - where I further tag and filter for easy reading and all that stuff.  
  
But as my subscription grows, I often get duplicate news. Duplicate doesn't mean a copy of but rather: reports by different people on the same kewl thing that just happened, e.g. [Check Out Google Maps!](http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&ie=UTF-8&q=google+maps&btnG=Search+News), [Microsoft and Nokia Marries](http://news.google.com/news?q=nokia+microsoft&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&sa=N&tab=nn&oi=newsr) ... and the list goes on. Yes I can "live with it" and skip the message and blah blah blah.. but I do wonder if Gmail can cluster that for me too. I understand this kind of clustering is different from Gmail's own email conversations (aka threads), but they already have the technology: Google News.  
  
Maybe say, Gmail gives me a predefined handler for tag "news" (like how "unread" is a reserved tag that shows all ur unread emails, try search label:unread). And everything in there will be threaded via Google News style, instead of the usual Gmail conversations. And even better, I can tick something, and auto-create a thread-specific filter to "mark as unread, skip inbox", call it the [] Same news different day checkbox. Yippie!  
  
Ahh.. things are just so easy when you ain't doing them yourself.
