It was exactly 300 days ago when [I started RssFwd](http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2004/11/11/rssfwd-v0-1a). Its wonderful how things turned out. Better stuff is in the works. Will post more about it soon.   
  
Btw, gotten a compliment today that [RssFwd](http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd) is an example of the fabled ["app-less" web-app](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/writeboard_the_appless_webapp.php) in the sense that users doesn't go about "using it". I'd never thought of it this way. Kewl! RssFwd will always maintain its non-intrusive nature. It will always be about the publisher and the reader. RssFwd will never be about RssFwd.  
  
Also, 2 new features to announce,

  
1. You can import your subscriptions from other aggregators (as long as you have an OPML file or url). Just visit the [Import Page](http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/import).
  
2. As a publisher, you can track how many RssFwd subscriptions are there on your feed. Just use this API /rssfwd/subscribers\_count?url=[your rss url] as an example, you can refer to [this URL](http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/subscribers_count?url=http://blog.yanime.org/xml/rss/feed.xml) - it retrieves the number of subscribers I have for my rss feed.
  
  
As usual, feedback is greatly appreciated.  
  
PS: Sorry, I'd forgotten who first asked for the OPML-import feature already. Whoever you are, sorry it took so long.  
  
PS: My prediction for [37signals's Writeboard](http://www.writeboard.com/)? Super kewl ajax, css, in-place editing: click anywhere, type anything, no page reloads. 1 url for sharing and collab.
