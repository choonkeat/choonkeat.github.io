The western father of Ruby, Dave Thomas, gave the opening keynote highlighting 3 unsolved problems in Rails (paying tribute to [the 23 problems of mathematics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_problems))

 
1. Database Integration:   

- ActiveRecord models to extract has\_many, belongs\_to, etc relationships directly from foreign keys,
- Migrations to absorb validation declarations: validates\_presence\_of, validates\_numericality\_of...  

- Real-world CRUD (Scaffold)

- Handles models' relationships  
- In-browser validation
- Skinning  
- AJAX  

- Deployment: Splitting Capistrano to 2

- Server capistrano declares policies and support
- Client capistrano declares what is needed (i.e.dependencies)

I'm sure I missed out some. So, there you go, a todo-list for Railers. Too bad RailsDay is over. A motivated 24-hour crunch is good for doing unsexy stuff like these.

And yea, I'll agree with Dave there, I mentioned this on e27 just the other day: **Ruby corrupted me!** I'm looking at Ruby code all day these days... and every other language source code is beginning to look so.. so ugly...

Session's startin. [See ya](http://facebook.railsconf.org/users/43).
