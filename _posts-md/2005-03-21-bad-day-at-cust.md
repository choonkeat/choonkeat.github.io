Visiting the States? Be sure to wear something they want to see, smell like something they want to smell and say things they want to hear. A blogger tried to visit the States last week, told the immigration he blogs and is meeting up with some online people. The immigration didn't believe you can talk to people you've never met, and don't know their telephone number (can you say I-C-Q ? But I'm sure American's would've preferred A-O-L.. so, better say _that_ next time) - detained him for 2hrs, gave him a strip search and denied his entry.

Reading his closure post, you can tell there ain't much bitterness (as much as I would've had) but just plenty of culture shock. There are plenty of [IT horror stories at the customs](http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000351.html), but this one is tops thus far.
