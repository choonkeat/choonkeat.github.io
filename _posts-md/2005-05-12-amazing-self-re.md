Checkout the videos [12mb download]! Very eerie feeling that I can't make out how I feel... they are alive.. and like a millipede that broke off and eww... See for yourself: [Link](http://www.mae.cornell.edu/ccsl/research/selfrep/)  
  
Reminds me of (recently saw the DVD) Aliens Vs Predator's self-configuring pyramid..   
  
But, my 2 cents say "replication" is a misleading word of choice (maybe only to hype things up).. 'cos that made me think it could somehow produced itself out of itself... but maybe that's just me.
