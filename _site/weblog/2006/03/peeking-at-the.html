<meta name="description" content="Web Developer&#39;s Quiz: Your website needs to somehow know what are the other websites a user had already visited. How do you do it? How do you get the information from a browser history? Kevin Burton pulled it off with a neat trick. When the new features of his Tailrank were released. I must&#39;ve been sleeping or busy, anyways, didn&#39;t check out the improvements in Tailrank till now. Under &quot;import&quot;, a user usually uploads his OPML file (which I&#39;d previously talked about), input some URLs, etc. In his attempt to make Tailrank&#39;s import applicable to more layman users, Kevin has a new &quot;Auto Configure&quot; button. Click on it, and a list of popular sites (that you&nbsp; have visited) are found and is ready for import. Damn, how did it know! I did some view-source hunting and found document.defaultView.getComputedStyle and element.currentStyle. Explain: Given that your browser will style visited links differently from link not yet visited, Kevin merely printed a bunch of hidden links and used a javascript to pick out those you have visited! Woot! I can sure find some use for that... hmm.. can&#39;t think of any now, but I&#39;m sure there&#39;re uses! That said, I would&#39;ve preferred if Tailrank actually gave me the option to uncheck some of them from my list (especially since removal of feeds isn&#39;t implemented yet)" />
