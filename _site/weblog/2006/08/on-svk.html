<meta name="description" content="Version control is the best thing since sliced bread (for those whom have just learnt of it). But once branching comes into the picture, it is becomes a hairy thing. It might be because humans aren&#39;t accustomed to think in terms of parallel universe (perhaps sci-fi authors). There appears to have no &quot;one right way&quot; to cater for all scenarios. I used to live and breath on the trunk-is-stable-and-latest camp (half sneering at enterprisey people who &#39;branch first, then merge&#39;). But it just happens that my past situations only requires so much. Furthermore, some people just prefer the branch-merge-often mentality, others thrive in simplicity of trunk-work-branch-maintain workflow. Like tea people and coffee people. Just different. No point converting anyone over to the other side. Hence I was dabbling to create a script (on-top-of svnmerge) to provide dead-simple branch/merge workflow - so trunk ppl can have it so, and branch ppl won&#39;t be inconvenienced. That&#39;s when I found SVK. By saying its a &quot;decentralized version control system built with the Subversion filesystem&quot; is really really doing it a huge disservice. My layman version would be &quot;SVK lets you be the branch-merge person you are inside, or the trunk-branch, or watever *%^#$ person you like to do your work in - whilst sharing a common repository with people of different taste! I mean, its like a cup that lets you sip coffee, sit around with everyone, whilst sharing the same pot of tea!&quot; SVK has more commands to do magic, but the daily stuff closely resembles SVN: svk commit; svk update; svk diff. It also has another benefit - it doesn&#39;t pollute your working directory with hidden .svn or CVS folders/files. Some ppl are irked by that. Those files are consolidated in your home directory. Actually that might be good / bad depending on you being a tea or coffee person. The only drawback is that IDE integration is lacking at the moment. And most importantly, the tickets / changesets information on Trac wouldn&#39;t tally directly with my local mirror. Oh well, these might not be show stopper after all. Let&#39;s see how it goes when I use it for real." />
