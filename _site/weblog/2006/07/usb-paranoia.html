<meta name="description" content="Almost a month ago I plugged a brand new USB thumbdrive into my desktop and it didn&#39;t work. &quot;Strange, &quot; I thought, &quot;it was working this morning at home...&quot;. However, a few weeks ago, I plugged in another known-to-be-working thumbdrive into my desktop and it didn&#39;t work either. And both drives don&#39;t work anymore. My Indian colleague came over, plugged his India brand thumbdrive into the port and it didn&#39;t work too - but it continue to work on his computer. So I thought I was just unlucky to have 2 lousy thumbdrives in a row. The only lucky thing is, I didn&#39;t lose critical data in both incidents. Revelation came a week ago when I plugged in my usb fan for a faster cool down after lunch. The fan was spinning, but there was no wind. The fan was spinning pretty fast... in the opposite direction! No wonder my thumbdrives died!!! As a result, I&#39;m now a bit paranoid when I have to plug something into an unfamiliar USB port - I have to know its a known-to-be-working port. Its funny because my paranoia apparently spreaded to my french colleague who had to plug his minty fresh external harddisk into his USB port.. without a fan to test. Damn, how did that India brand USB continue to survive?" />
