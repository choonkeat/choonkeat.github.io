<meta name="description" content="Mihai Parparita has done it again. Not only did he author my favourite (and prettiest) Greasemonkey script: Gmail Macros, he has now gone ahead and integrated Google Reader with Gmail, using only Greasemonkey. Btw, talk about &quot;throw it against the wall and see what sticks&quot;... Greasemonkey is probably one of the best enabler of such technique! I&#39;ve imported all my RssFwd subscriptions over to Google Reader to try out Mihai&#39;s Gmail Reader. So far so good. A few kinks here and there (e.g. unread Feeds doesn&#39;t bold like other labels, Gmail Macros can&#39;t go to Feeds with &#39;G, F&#39; keystroke) but no show-stopper, and definitely nothing an official integration wouldn&#39;t fix - if there is one. There are differences between using RssFwd + Gmail and Google Reader + Gmail. In the former, content is &quot;in your hands&quot;. Emails are plain old emails. Take them anywhere, filter them, fwd them, do anything to them. We&#39;ve had emails for donkey years now, there must be at least a hundred tricks you can do with emails - and none of them requires any new features from anybody. On the other hand, Google Reader (like most RSS readers) will need to work towards making such tools/features available. The lack of features that we take for granted in the good&#39;ol email makes the content in such readers feel more... transient in comparison. I guess its just a matter of what suits you. For me, I&#39;m giving myself sometime to see if this Gmail Reader usage pattern groove with me :-) PS: What/How long does it take for Google to officially integrate Persistent Search &amp; Gmail Macros? Just do it already! *sigh*" />
