<meta name="description" content="Keep up to date through out the day? Have a 1-look overview of all updates? Pick 1. That&#39;s what &quot;email digests&quot; means. You get to read only 1 single email containing all the updates - BUT you only get them at the end of the day. That may suit some people, but not me. So RssFwd has a new feature today. Introducing a clustered view that allow readers to have the best of both worlds! With the help from Gmail of course (and any other e-mail program that has grown up to implement threading intelligently). To enable, just tick the &quot;clustered&quot; option at preview page. You get the benefit of keeping up to date wheneva you want to - the individual updates just keeps flowing in as individual emails. Additionally, you get the benefit of a reading everything on a single page when you choose to (end of day, start of day, end of week,... your pick!) RssFwd is attempting to de-throne Google&#39;s own, /cackle, and be the defacto RSS reader on Gmail. Hm, then again.. Google Reader was never meant to integrate with Gmail was it?" />
