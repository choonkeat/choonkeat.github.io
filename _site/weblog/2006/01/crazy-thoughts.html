I know there&#39;s already several ways to help/add/modify Rails..&nbsp; there are generators, helpers, and the (kind of) new plugins. But engines? Rails Engines are a way of dropping in whole chunks of functionality into your existing application without affecting any of your existing code. They could also be described as mini-applications, or vertical application slices &ndash; top-to-bottom units which provide full MVC coverage for a certain, specific application function. (see http://rails-engines.org/ ) Interesting.. I can think of a few uses of mini-apps already... so now, let&#39;s look at what the community has written for each (from the wiki): Plugins, Rails Engines, 3rdPartyLibs. 3rdPartyHelpers and AvailableGenerators. Yea. The first thought that comes to mind is... mess. So many selections that I think there might be enough mess for a distro to happen. e.g. In RailsX distro, the scaffolded apps is ajax-ified, or RailsY distro comes ready with a login/password/forget-password mini-app, or RailsZ has defaults optimized for speed (imho, more aptly named as shinkansen).. OpenRails is optimized for security... EasyRails comes complete with Ruby installed and servers configured... oops, that&#39;s already InstantRails, though I&#39;m not sure if it had intended itself to be. Anyways, distros are much better than forking aye? And to some extent, might just relieve the core team from dealing with a variety of wishes. In whichever case, if distros do happen, lets just hope the package distribution mechanism remains on the plate of the core so that things will work cross-distro- think RPM, DEB,.. and then there&#39;s Ubuntu DEB.. irk!" />
