    <p>I've just migrated this blog from old Typo to <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">Typepad</a>, and hence completing my technology adoption cycle (for this area):</p><blockquote><p>Phase 1: Unexplored realm! Read<br />Phase 2: Hands-on. Learn<br />Phase 3: Move on</p></blockquote><p>Phase 2 often implies acts of compiling, scouring forums, reading HOWTOs, configuring and hosting my own, e.g. Qmail, blog, etc. Phase 3 doesn't always imply learning <em>everything</em> about it, but usually learning enough to be reserving time &amp; resources for other unexplored technologies.</p>

<p>So, apologies for raising false alarms in feed readers of new posts. Isn't the point of Feedburner to make blog hosting migration seamless?</p>

<p>Anyways, I'd secretly been wanting a Wordpress blog for a while now (only because it has a beautiful interface and big serif fonts. I'm soooo superficial!), so was checking out Wordpress.com for a while. Unfortunately, they don't do Feedburner and, to make things worse, <a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2007/06/13/retiring-feed-stats/">they just killed their own feed statistics as well</a>.</p>

<p>Next, Blogger.com - with a name like that, you just know they're the right choice aye? Blogger has Atom APIs (cue Phase2) and Feedburner integration (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/23/100-million-payday-for-feedburner-this-deal-is-confirmed/">of course</a>). Great! But they have butt ugly templates. I convinced myself that can change later and I proceeded to write a little Typo2Blogger importer using <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/gdata-ruby">GData-Ruby</a> (Phase2!). <br /><br />1... 2.. 3... 40... 41.. Beep! I was stopped before attaining <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=answer%20to%20life%20the%20universe%20and%20everything">the meaning of life</a>! The script ran smoothly but everything after 41st import was ignored. <a href="http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=42578">They think I'm spam</a>. Lots of people were apparently bitten by this as well. One user suggested contacting the Admins, and subsequently migrating only 5 post a day to keep Blogger.com happy. Kowtow? Tsk tsk. If migrants are not welcomed, then fine. Without proper comments import, the prospects weren't too hot in the first place *sour*</p>

<p>That leaves us with <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">Typepad</a>. Feedburner, <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/typepad/news/2006/06/typepad_and_feedburner.html">check</a>. Full import, <a href="http://support.typepad.com/cgi-bin/typepad.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=197">check</a> (the prehistoric, non-XML format worked flawlessly on first try). Can't be that bad. At least <a href="http://ambermac.typepad.com/">Amber</a> seems happy using it.</p>
