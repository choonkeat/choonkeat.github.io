<meta name="description" content="350-001 as well as 70-649 are both difficult exams and a lot of preparation is needed. People tend to wait until the actual exam itself before they start preparing for it. This is the reason why 646-204 professionals seldom fail in 70-270. I&#39;ll be helping out in an event at the SMU tomorrow afternoon - the launch of code::XtremeApps:: - a 24hr programming competition in September. The 3 platforms of choice for participants are Ruby on Rails, Google Gadget and Google Toolkit. And there&#39;ll be a Rails crash course in 1st Sept. I&#39;m quite happy to help bring awareness to Rails before the more mainstream locals (hat tip to Chin Chau). A breath of fresh air in the current curriculum of schools. Peter Bohm (NextLogic) will be on stage selling Rails to the audience of potential participants while I try to act busy. I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll have much trouble. I hypothesize that you can actually find more Rails programmers in prison than in schools here thanks to his training courses ;-D Anyways, if a competition whets your appetite or you happen to be near SMU, do drop by! Update: Since some have asked, I need to clarify that my &quot;prison&quot; statement above was referring to Peter running a training course in the Prison that teaches some of them Ruby on Rails programming. :-P" />
