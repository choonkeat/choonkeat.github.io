So, the keywords i guess is: quick &amp; agile. a) Ruby the scripting language? maybe its a the joy of learning a new language... but ruby is quite fun to code in, albeit the lack of code-completion editors (maybe not for long). but perhaps its b&#39;cos i&#39;d programmed without code-completion for the larger part so can still settle with that lack. update: I&#39;d forgotten to mention that I missed the power and ease of arrays in a scripting language (compared to Java or C), and also the code block syntax in Ruby is insanely cool even when compared to a beautiful language like Python. b) The framework (What part of it) I like that it comes with a pretty good ORM. Also, I only need to know very few conventions to get started. Yes these can be generalized into &quot;small learning curve&quot;. Why no Java/.Net/C++/VB etc has copied it point for point then ? Regarding clones, there is: .Net, Java, Python, even PHP. But who&#39;s interested? - and that&#39;s actually quite important question: Can framework-X garner the same level of PR/momentum/growth?

Well, wouldn&#39;t that somebody rather use Rails instead? unless, of cos, they&#39;ve an axe to grind against Rails. c) The domain chosen? hmm, don&#39;t really understand. its for building general web apps. d) The philosophy ? Probably. convention over configuration is probably the first breath of fresh air. i&#39;d originally cited this as a &quot;no xml config file nightmare&quot; thing, but actually it runs deeper, especially parameters passed to-and-fro forms/post, database column naming, before_* after_* hooks (benefits from very primitive AOP), where the files are placed (easy to learn another app) etc. When doing Rails, I feel as if somebody has felt the same pain as I and here are his consolidated solution for each and every problem, and I gratefully receive a solution for our lessons learnt. Very little things - may be detrimental to cite this example and make it seem like child&#39;s play.. but I found myself smiling when I learnt this - like e.g. having an &#39;employee_counter&#39; column in the &quot;companies&quot; table.. just having it and Rails will do the rest: e.g. +1 whenever a new &quot;employees&quot; record is inserted. very little things. update: also, a verbose error 500 page with stacktrace, session data, http parameters by default - but when in production mode, outside world sees &#39;friendly error page&#39;.. but localhost still gives you the verbose errors to help debugging, how thoughtful!
