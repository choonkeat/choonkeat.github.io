When someone says its no good, I feel like my child&#39;s been told he&#39;s ugly. I was even accused of being a Linux bigot. But I still don&#39;t think Linux is ready for mainstream desktop usage. By mainstream, I mean adoption. Not technically ready or not. Adoption in the future? Yes (please!). Now? No. And so, I&#39;m quite sad to see this article and what&#39;s more surprising is that Dvorak recommended it so highly: &quot;This is hands down the best article I&rsquo;ve read in the past year.&quot; Really? Now, I think I&#39;m probably more sad that that&#39;s the best article Linux desktop argument can go. I like the article&#39;s observation that it is unfair for Linux that John-Doe-type users jumps to Linux without knowing anything only to leave with a disgusted experience. Good start. I can also agree to his comments on &quot;Filesystems, C:, D:, etc&quot; being a non-issue. But don&#39;t be ridicolous tellimg me that typing &quot;emerge gaim&quot; is difficult, please. The fact the user has no training for typing &quot;emerge foo&quot; IS WRONG, not the package manager. Users need to learn, THEN to use the system. Would you click on an executable installer, if no one ever told you that&#39;s the way to install software? Yahh... but before I gathered my own thoughts properly, he moved on to describe how to deal with non-packaged applications... and compiling. That&#39;s it. Yes, given a 2-lab-rat scenario I&#39;d agree (almost, see next para). I would even argue that the lab-rat typing &quot;emerge foo&quot; will find it smoother to do. Usability. But gravity pulls down and Windows is double-click install. These are facts even lab tests should adhere to. The Linux way may be more elegant, manageable. But without a bridge from Windows-land it&#39;ll not work. Assuming that new users has no background is really quite a stretch. Even the then-new-comer Microsoft Excel had to bend to Lotus 123&#39;s rules before winning their market. [Update: I figure this Joel article is a better example.] But.. Linux has double-click installers too! All of them? Most of them? Some this, some that... but that&#39;s not a fault of Linux in itself - its a diverse, vibrant community - but when it comes to adoption and learnability, that&#39;s a glaring hole. How do you tell a your restaurant customer, with a straight face, &quot;Tell the waitress your order she&#39;ll bring to your table.. meat only.
