<meta name="description" content="New book to get my hands on: My Job Went To India (and all I got was this lousy book). It may be a controversial sounding title to the more sensitive. But I beg you see past that. I&#39;ve just read the 6 PDF snippets (ex content page), and I&#39;d give it thumbs up - loved them all! While managing an application development group, I once asked one of my employees, &ldquo;What do you want to do with your career? What do you want to be?&rdquo; I was terribly disppointed by his answer: &ldquo;I want to be a J2EE architect.&rdquo; I asked why not a &ldquo;Microsoft Word designer&rdquo; or a &ldquo;RealPlayer installer?&rdquo; This guy wanted to build his career around a specific technology created by a specific company of which he was not an employee. What if the company goes out of business? What if it let its now-sexy technology become obsolete? Why would you want to trust a technology company with your career? - Your Eggs in Someone Else&#39;s Basket [pdf] Love would be smirking now at my chosen snippet - it resonates my thoughts on people whom are &quot;Flash-programmer and nothing else&quot;... which I find to be rather common trait these days. ARGH. I&#39;ve been on a buying spree (sorry honey) and I&#39;ll have to bite my lips on this one until it comes to the local Borders - instead of getting it online (or the PDF-only version, if they should start releasing? pls? no?) I&#39;ve heard of a story, where a boss read &quot;Who Moved My Cheese&quot;, loved it and pass to his #2 man. That guy read it, inspired, passed to the #3 guy and left the company. The #3 guy read it, inspired, passed to a #4 guy and left the company as well! The boss quickly took the book away and stopped the circulation he&#39;d started. I&#39;m afraid this book will have such power. Hence, even though I&#39;m not a boss nor have I read the whole book yet, I&#39;m hesitant on how to best recommend it. For a start, maybe you can read the PDFs I haven&#39;t recommended. (yes mich, that includes you)" />
