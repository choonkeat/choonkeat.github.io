<meta name="description" content="About a month old article, but I realise quite a few of us haven&#39;t seen it yet: Online Gambling: Buy a Bot to play for you For $200, you can buy the full package: a one-year subscription to the team edition, which includes the autoplaying bot and a card-sharing module that allows multiple players to communicate during a game. Bornert won&#39;t say how many customers he has; he&#39;ll admit only that he makes a living selling WinHoldEm [emphasis mine] Now ethics aside, I&#39;d say that&#39;s a brilliant idea! Getting a computer to gamble for you only lets you play in a methodical, steady manner while you sleep at night and wake up a few bucks richer.. but Team mode just puts you one up against the dealer! As YP says, FOOK! Grok said before he&#39;s quite inspired by Bram Cohen&#39;s success story... I&#39;d say this one is quite inspiring as well :-D Quick! Now think of an evil but obvious-idea! Oh no! I can&#39;t come up with any! My head&#39;s full of gambling bot now.. and about why i didn&#39;t come up with Team mode - arghh... On other stuff, Adam Bosworth gives a good talk on how software should be designed and developed evolved: Intelligent Reaction. Good stuff! Been busy with something of late, will lift the curtain soon :-)" />
