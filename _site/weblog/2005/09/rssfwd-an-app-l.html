<meta name="description" content="It was exactly 300 days ago when I started RssFwd. Its wonderful how things turned out. Better stuff is in the works. Will post more about it soon. Btw, gotten a compliment today that RssFwd is an example of the fabled &quot;app-less&quot; web-app in the sense that users doesn&#39;t go about &quot;using it&quot;. I&#39;d never thought of it this way. Kewl! RssFwd will always maintain its non-intrusive nature. It will always be about the publisher and the reader. RssFwd will never be about RssFwd. Also, 2 new features to announce, You can import your subscriptions from other aggregators (as long as you have an OPML file or url). Just visit the Import Page. As a publisher, you can track how many RssFwd subscriptions are there on your feed. Just use this API /rssfwd/subscribers_count?url=[your rss url] as an example, you can refer to this URL - it retrieves the number of subscribers I have for my rss feed. As usual, feedback is greatly appreciated. PS: Sorry, I&#39;d forgotten who first asked for the OPML-import feature already. Whoever you are, sorry it took so long. PS: My prediction for 37signals&#39;s Writeboard? Super kewl ajax, css, in-place editing: click anywhere, type anything, no page reloads. 1 url for sharing and collab." />
