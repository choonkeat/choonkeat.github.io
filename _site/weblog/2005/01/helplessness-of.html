<meta name="description" content="I&#39;ve always found myself frowning a bit whenever I need to fill up some form, online or offline, in order to get something I need. Especially when it asks for, Your E-mail: ___________ The worries are that they&#39;ll send me things I didn&#39;t want and didn&#39;t ask for (aka spam). Or, they&#39;ll pass my email to somebody who&#39;ll send me things that I didn&#39;t want and didn&#39;t ask for. Or, my email will be somehow listed in some dark corners of the world, gets picked up by email harvesters and used by those somebodies who&#39;ll send me things... you get the drift. Either way, it means plainly that whenever I divulge my email its as good as f***ed. There are a few ways I&#39;d combated this. Give fake emails (Oops! But I&#39;m not Eric Stellwagon). Give my f***ed-long-ago hotmail which now filters everything to trash (hmm, is it still active? nevermind..), Give disposable email aliases... then what emails do I give to sign-up their service? -sigh- Its only viable when you own a domain name yourself... or is it? Looks like there is a way to make your own disposable email address. And it looks like Gmail and (surprisingly) my company email (a feature of Hurricane email?) supports it. Yahoo, doesn&#39;t appear to support. For purpose of demonstration, I&#39;ll use hotmail.com... but whether Hotmail supports it, I don&#39;t know. Suppose your email is joe@hotmail.com, try sending yourself an email to joe+testing@hotmail.com. If you do receive it, you&#39;re in. If the mail bounces back, then move along now, nothing else for your to read here. Now, what does this mean? It means you can now chute-pattern! Yea! Power to the people! Say you sign up for a Best-Car-Deal membership.. and they say don&#39;t worry they&#39;ll never pass your info to blah blah blah,... and your spider sense tells you otherwise, give joe+chutepattern@hotmail.com (ooh, inconspicuous! evil!)... then somedays later, as your hunch proves correct, you receive some p****-enlargement spam sent To: joe+chutepattern@hotmail.com in your mailbox... you&#39;ll know which ass-&#39;ole sold you out. If you don&#39;t appear listed on the email To: or CC: list, the spammer has used the Bcc: . For such instances, you can always check by looking at the mail header for some lines saying Delivered-To: or something to that effect. Now go! Go chute all your patterns on them! Have no mercy..." />
