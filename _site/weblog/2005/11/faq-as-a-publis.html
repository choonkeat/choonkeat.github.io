In short, "no".<br/>
<br/>
RssFwd's core belief is that feeds let subscribers choose to subscribe or unsubscribe -- <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">r</span>isk free</span></span>. This is also the fundamental difference between feeds (rss/atom) and traditional (<span style="font-style: italic;">did i say that?</span>) &quot;e-newsletters&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This <span style="font-style: italic;">risk </span>is the risk of email address misuse, aka spam, and it's perceived to (its irrelevant whether truth or myth) come from the publishers &amp; affiliates, and is also an unnecessary barrier for people when they just want to <span style="font-style: italic;">listen in</span> and subscribe to content.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the question RssFwd asks is, '<span style="font-style: italic;">What does a publisher really want to do with the email addresses, other than to disseminate more content? If it's really so, isn't that already being done via the existing feed to the existing subscribers?</span>' [Btw, the number of subscribers <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2005/09/07/rssfwd-an-app-less-web-app">is revealed</a>] <br/>
<br/>
I do see the audacity of the above stand being interpreted as &quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">you can't trust them with your email address,.. come trust RssFwd!</span>&quot; :-P But I guess only time will tell. <br/>
<br/>
An arguably weak solution is that RssFwd actually <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com/rssfwd/developers">promotes</a> anyone to download and run their own RssFwd service, so privacy paranoids can choose to either run their own, or use a RssFwd service run by someone they trust.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aside:</span> Its heart warming to know RssFwd was a candidate as the new &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program">Hello World</a>&quot; application when learning a new programming framework: <a href="http://fatbobman-notes.blogspot.com/2005/11/rss-feed.html">Fatbobman tries</a> to familiarize himself with Django this way.</p>
