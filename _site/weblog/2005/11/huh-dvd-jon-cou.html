First of all, I was surprised the said Singaporean manufacturer was actually kewl enough to see past a sue and actually offered him a job... then, I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t even respond to him. I don&#39;t think its got to do with the age - I&#39;m quite sure they&#39;ve gotten so far as to have offered him a job, they&#39;d at least paid him a free-lance fee to do next driver. Actually I&#39;m not sure what company it is. RFC Distribution? It could be because they went under.. since searching the company name yields no results. Who is DVD Jon? Well, he&#39;s the guy who sparked the find of the world&#39;s first prime number.. the first illegal prime number." />

    <p>Surprised by <a href="http://nanocrew.net/2005/11/18/22-am-i-old-enough/">DVD Jon's post</a> yesterday. First of all, I was surprised the said Singaporean manufacturer was actually kewl enough to see past a sue and actually offered him a job... then, I'm surprised they didn't even respond to him. I don't think its got to do with the age - I'm quite sure they've gotten so far as to have offered him a job, they'd at least paid him a free-lance fee to do next driver. <br/>
<br/>
Actually I'm not sure what company it is. <a href="http://it.asia1.com.sg/reviews/storage/sto001_19990705.html">RFC Distribution</a>? It could be because they went under.. since <a href="https://www.psi.gov.sg/NASApp/tmf/TMFServlet?app=RCB-BIZFILE-BIZCODIR">searching</a> the company name yields no results.<br/>
<br/>
Who is DVD Jon? Well, he's the guy who sparked the find of the world's first prime number.. <br/>
