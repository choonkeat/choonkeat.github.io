<meta name="description" content="LAMP is good? You agree? I agree. My last 3 companies are all on LAMP. The LAMP combo (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python)&nbsp; powered countless dotcoms (and many ISVs even now) and is accepted by most folks as a decent and cheap server setup. Good starting point? Even Java folks are comfortable to acknowledge, &quot;LAMP is an enabling, agile combo, but for enterprise systems [insert keywords of scalability,&nbsp; web services, BEPL]...&quot; whatever.. so, bottom line is LAMP is not necessarily excellent, but good enough? Also, agree with me that its kewl to replace the &quot;P&quot; with basically anything you like aye? Some people like Perl. Some people prefer Python. Agree? Whichever the case, LAMP is LAMP - its light, cheap (free!) and good. Oh! and some will add Tomcat, and use Java - LAM* bah! - still the same: light, cheap and good. Agree? Why then, may I ask, that when I mention Rails does the weather look different? Can it scale? Does it support 2-phase commits? Transactions? Speed? Sheesh. Now when did those demeaning questions pop up in discussions of LAMP? I just changed the &quot;P&quot; didn&#39;t I? LAMP is still LAMP? Or is it now no more? In fact, its a LAMP+ (read: plus a thought out development framework, out of the box, ready for use) Now LAMP doesn&#39;t come with a framework - that missing last mile? - build your own, collect, assemble into what your team of developers can use to churn out web applications after web applications.. lemme see, where do we-the-new-startup begin? Ok, let&#39;s do... The Login framework! oh yes, we need some database wrappers that we can - check this out - reuse! DIY. BYO. Yay! Now, I&#39;d figure what the difference is - wrong fight. Any discussion on Rails leading to J2EE and scaling should be henceforth be halted, stopped - not a word spoken more. Instead, civil discussions should come from the angle of &quot;Why choose LAMP and start with zero?&quot; After you&#39;d install LAMP you can&#39;t groovy yet.. but after you have installed Rails, it would&#39;ve scaffolded you high enough to develop those apps, straightaway. Any new adopters to LAMP should be rescued from Web1.0 hazards, and nourished in Rails. PS: It is often easier to scale up, than scale down. And when one tries to scale down its kitchen sink (i.e. become agile) - they gotta throw it all away. Now, why would you want to scale down? Go figure - only thing is, when you do, just don&#39;t start from zero." />
