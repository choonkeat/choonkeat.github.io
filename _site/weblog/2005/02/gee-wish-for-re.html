Duplicate doesn&#39;t mean a copy of but rather: reports by different people on the same kewl thing that just happened, e.g. Check Out Google Maps!, Microsoft and Nokia Marries ... and the list goes on. Yes I can &quot;live with it&quot; and skip the message and blah blah blah.. but I do wonder if Gmail can cluster that for me too. I understand this kind of clustering is different from Gmail&#39;s own email conversations (aka threads), but they already have the technology: Google News.Maybe say, Gmail gives me a predefined handler for tag &quot;news&quot; (like how &quot;unread&quot; is a reserved tag that shows all ur unread emails, try search label:unread). And everything in there will be threaded via Google News style, instead of the usual Gmail conversations. And even better, I can tick something, and auto-create a thread-specific filter to &quot;mark as unread, skip inbox&quot;, call it the [ ] Same news different day checkbox. Yippie!Ahh.. things are just so easy when you ain&#39;t doing them yourself." />
