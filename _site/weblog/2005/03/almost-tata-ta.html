Perhaps it was the interview that tipped me. &quot;... real-world projects don&#39;t run like an organized, Gantt-charted project plan. Real projects are chaotic: missed deadlines, miscommunication, scope creep, new initiatives, new people in, old people out. There&#39;s a lot of stuff to be said, but nowhere to say it, store it, and organize it. That&#39;s where Basecamp comes in...&quot; How true. These people appear to face what I&#39;m facing (I don&#39;t suck after all!).. Perhaps they, with this understanding, could be The One to give me something that addresses my issues with (project) management. Or perhaps its just that I&#39;ve been using Ta-da quite a lot and am just waiting for the reason to try the full product. Anyways, so far so good. I&#39;m liking what I see and can imagine how it melds into my daily routines. Goodbye, Yahoo Calendar - the dinosaur I irk to use because there&#39;s nothing else. (Wonder if Basecamp can feature repeatable events.. that&#39;ll be complete) However, I&#39;m pretty surprised - considering their close affiliation - there&#39;s nothing about Tada in Basecamp. What&#39;s for a user whom have learnt to appreciate the Ta-da way, created a few lists of many many items.. to switch to Basecamp? For now, looks like I have to import them myself - 1 by 1.. I mean, hey even Multiply has a module to import from a competitor, Friendster. &quot;Convert to Free Basecamp account&quot; link in Ta-da would be kewl. Click and I have my (new or existing) Basecamp account plus all my Ta-da lists intact. Painless upgrade. Until then, I&#39;ll be slowly shifting my 6 lists and 40+ todos.. or live with checking 2 different sites (irk) PS: Also, how about adding link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; title=&quot;RSS&quot; href=&quot;...&quot; somewhere in the header of pages so that the cute, cute orange Subscribe icon can appear at my Firefox bottom-right? In any case, it&#39;ll be good consistency. :-)" />
