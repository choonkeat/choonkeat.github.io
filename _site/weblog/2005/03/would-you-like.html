Quite interesting.. a more interactive extension to 3rd Voice (if any of you still remembers.. it was year 2000..)This company Jybe has done a toolbar for both IE and Firefox (Yay!) unfortunately requires lousy Internet-v1.0-style registration and newsletters checkboxes and blah.Anyways, was looking for a demo before installing. No luck. So decided to do my own. Check it out here: Jybe Demo [swf, dis-coloring due to optimized swf filesize..], and see if you like it - for business use (e.g. real-time website design approval with clients) or personal use (e.g. can&#39;t think of yet)I think it&#39;ll be better if participants don&#39;t have to &quot;join&quot; a session like now. Its a learning/adoption hurdle. A better interface than &quot;click join &gt; enter name &gt; enter channel&quot;.. is a special URL I can easily pass to another person - &quot;Hey check this out, http://..... &quot; - for he/she to click on, and immediately we&#39;re co-surfing (assuming toolbar installed on both parties). Of cos, &quot;assuming toolbar installed&quot; is a hurdle itself, but that&#39;s deployment issue.And knowing that our browsing is going through a 3rd party server is quite sucky, especially for business use.
