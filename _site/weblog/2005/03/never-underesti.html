<meta name="description" content="Update: Rectified the title of this entry *sheepish* Didn&#39;t realised it was truncated by plog In a perfect world, a user will give RssFwd a feed url [example] and RssFwd will display a nicely formatted preview [example]. At the bottom of the preview page, the user can choose to subscribe by entering his email and submitting a form. Q.E.D.However, this isn&#39;t a perfect world, and instead of the feed url, users often give the main url of the site [example] or anything they see in their browser location bar. For such cases, RssFwd chokes and show an unfriendly page, &quot;You *****! That&#39;s an invalid RSS/Atom feed url!&quot;, and prompts the user to try another url... as if he&#39;ll understand now that he&#39;s been lectured. And as far as I know, this is apparently the usual behavior of most rss applications - stopping at the scary, but friendly-worded error message.But educating newcomer folks on &quot;How to locate the xml/rss/atom icon&quot;, or &quot;Right-click &gt; copy link&quot; (for feeds that show &#39;Download/Save-As?&#39; when you click on them [example]) seem like an awfully uphill task; On the other hand, sitting back and relying on the masses to catch-up will only hinder adoption of that RSS thing. Unnecessary delays.So, I guess the easier way is to educate the web-publishers. Since you are publishing feeds already, I&#39;d figure you&#39;ll care more. Publishers, (most major blogging tools already does so) make sure your pages carry the link ref=alternate tags. Btw, this same tags that lets Firefox show that orange icon on the bottom-right. Such tags allows programs to know that your page has feeds, and what are the feeds.Now, if RssFwd cannot preview a given url, it will autodetect for hidden link ref=alternate tags and check to find the actual feed on behalf of the user. Meaning, previewing (a main page) will just work (Rule #1). No more errors*.Initially this was done for the benefit of RSS-challenged folks... but I&#39;m beginning to find that.. I&#39;m liking the convenience myself. So, for any webpage, you can dive straight into preview - If there&#39;s a feed, it&#39;ll pick up for ya. No more icon hunting.*Disclaimer: Websites with no RSS/Atom feeds at all will still not render." />
