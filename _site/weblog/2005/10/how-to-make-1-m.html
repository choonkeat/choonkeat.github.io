Now we just get boring email spams and no fun factor. I guess the motivation is different. So now, forget Jotlive, or Writely.. this must be the fun-est Ajax usage: How to Make 1 Million Friends on MySpace. someone by the name of Samy wrote a social network popularity worm... and made over a million new friends, all of whom now had the text &ldquo;but most of all, samy is my hero&rdquo; in their self-description. Here&#39;s the How, the Interview, and ... of cos where&#39;s the fun without &quot;Samy is My Hero&quot; T-shirts? Funny people :-) Only one nitpick question I have on the whole scenario though.. if Samy wished to stop the virus.. &quot;I absolutely wanted to stop it. Deleting my account wouldn&rsquo;t stop propagation at all, but I tried that anyway.&quot; Why can&#39;t he modify his original script on his profile, and spread a virus-removal virus?" />
