    <p>While looking for a place to start learning programming, my friend Phil brought this to my attention: <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2012/06/19/codecademy-closes-10-million-round/">Codecademy Closes $10 Million Round</a>. He asked me what I think of it [as a place for him to start].</p>

<p>While I applaud their existence, and congratulate their funding, I doubt I would&#8217;ve gotten into programming if I were introduced via something like <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m lazy, impatient and have lots of things I&#8217;d rather be doing than whatever I&#8217;m doing right now. And I definitely don&#8217;t want to sit through grammar school, regardless of whether it was English language or the lovely Ruby programming language. I find programming interesting only because gets me results.</p>

<p>Story was, our home PC&#8217;s 40mb hard disk crashed and we were left with whatever that was on floppies. My brother borrowed a book from the library with computer games inside. I would boot up the computer, ran &#8220;gwbasic&#8221;, choose a game from the book, and type all the gibberish code into the computer, character by character. Some games were a few lines long, some spanned a few pages. After everything was typed in, I&#8217;d run and play my game.</p>

<p>I remember especially liking a cowboy fast draw turn-based game that had dice roll based on your character&#8217;s stats (speed, accuracy), distance, dealt damages based on the gun you used and where you hit. It was fun.</p>

<p>Before long I realize I didn&#8217;t have to transcribe every character in the book. If I changed some numbers, the computer wouldn&#8217;t know it came from me, and the game would play out differently. I made the games better (or worse, depending on whether you think god-mode is a good thing or not).</p>

<p>Before long I realize I didn&#8217;t have to transcribe <em>anything</em> from the book. If I&#8217;d just written anything I wanted, the computer wouldn&#8217;t know <em>none</em> of it came from the book. The computer would follow <em>my</em> instructions and run <em>my</em> game like it would run the games from the book.</p>

<p>Wow. I am as authoritative to the computer as The Book.</p>

<p>(The next big milestone would come several years later, when I produced my first &#8220;.exe&#8221; file. aka, shit just got real.)</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m biased to think that programming should only ever be introduced as a means to get something real done or done faster. Hacking on something you already understand. Then there is a purpose and motivation to learn. Then programming is meaningful. It is sad [to me] to know that some people&#8217;s first contact with programming would be a dry grammar class (or some patronizing guided tour to nowhere, &#8221;<em>yippie, you can count!</em>&#8221;) that they just <em>have</em> to sit through to learn, no biggie, like everything else they&#8217;d done in school.</p>

<blockquote><p>This essay was an immune response, triggered by hearing too many times that <a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">Inventing on Principle</a> was &#8220;about live coding&#8221;, and seeing too many attempts to &#8220;teach programming&#8221; by adorning a JavaScript editor with badges and mascots.</p>
