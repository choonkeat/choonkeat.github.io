    <p>I was <a href="http://soundgecko.com">listening</a> to <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/11/5/gone-fishin-building-super-scalable-systems-blade-runner-mee.html">a post from High Scalability</a> today, and it reminded me of this old talk</p>

<blockquote>
  the spread of an epidemic can provide a model for the spread of information throughout a network and &hellip; techniques based on that model can be used to create ultra-scalable software infrastructures that exhibit unparalleled robustness and scalability properties.
  <br/>
  &mdash; <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail459.html">Werner Vogels, E-Commerce at Interplanetary Scale</a>
</blockquote>


<p>Taken to its logical conclusion, instead of our familiar client-server architectures, &#8220;everybody&#8221; will have to be hosting a piece of the system in order for us to reach where Werner Vogels describe: scale is no longer a problem to tackle but like a virus, the more nodes there are, the more robust the system.</p>

<p>Even if we solve the technical issues, the first big hurdle is actually: how do we convince everyone to run a piece of infrastructure 24x7?</p>

<h3>Go To Market</h3>

<p>At AllThingsD, when asked to comment on a TV product, Steve Jobs implied that the problem is not purely technical; he rightfully pointed out that there was no <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/12/23/video-steve-jobs-on-tvs-go-to-market-problem/">good go-to-market-strategy</a>. To appreciate how a go-to-market-strategy can make or break a product, let&#8217;s consider the original iPhone: a beautiful jewel in your hands, but a rather lame cell phone (poor battery life, no 3g, no keyboard)</p>

<p>Who knows if the entire vision was already there, but the initial focus was solely on the beautiful device &amp; beautiful interface. While flying lame and humble under the radar of incumbent players, get <em>this pretty device</em> into enough affluent people&#8217;s hands, and while they&#8217;re smitten, require an unlimited data plan (imho, a critical but understated move in 2007).</p>

<p>Later, a reveal: hey Mac developers, a few million rich people is using our phone, running your familiar OS X, has 24x7 internet connection, plays video, mp3, has GPS, has Google Map, real web browser, multi-touch, accelerometer, camera, compass… Wanna sell them some apps? (you <em>have</em> to time-travel back to 2007 to appreciate how impossibly desirable that was)</p>

<p>The proverbial chicken and egg hurdle was deftly leapt over with a feint.</p>

<h3>Interplanetary Scale</h3>

<p>Space Monkey says they are <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/clintgc/space-monkey-taking-the-cloud-out-of-the-datacente">taking the cloud out of the datacentre</a>, then they talk about the <a href="http://www.spacemonkey.com/">1TB of storage… your photos, videos, documents, and music</a>. You&#8217;d think they&#8217;re building a Dropbox, iCloud or Amazon S3. Perhaps they do really mean just that.</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s assume they don&#8217;t :-)</p>

<h3>Feint</h3>

<p>While Dropbox is a darling right now and &#8220;Cloud&#8221; is buzzword, Space Monkey is quite a desirable consumer device. So use that story and get the device into the hands of a big enough group of geeky people (Kickstarter hurray!)</p>

<p>Later, a reveal: hey developers, we have a big group of rich geeky people hosting our computer servers across the globe, powered up and connected to the internet 24x7, with a TB of storage each… Wanna sell them some apps?</p>

<h3>Botnet App Store</h3>

<p>What if an app running on this &#8220;data center&#8221; cost nothing extra to scale up? Instead of paying for computing resources in East Coast of USA to serve users in Australia, how about if every user &#8220;pay for their fair share&#8221; instead?</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say users install your app from Space Monkey &#8220;app store&#8221;, onto their own device. Your app runs off that device at home, stores their own content there too. Users can still access your app from Starbucks like a regular SaaS app (Space Monkey &#8220;data centre&#8221; platform takes care of that, no worries)</p>

<p>Nay sayers may immediately say &#8220;that&#8217;s a lame data centre! you can&#8217;t possibly launch a search engine this way!&#8221;. Some types of app won&#8217;t work well (Google.com, Amazon.com), but others could potentially thrive (Shopify, Gmail, Dropbox).</p>

<p>And being lame to incumbent products is not always a bad thing.</p>

<h3>&#8220;If you’re not paying for the product, you are the product&#8221;</h3>

<p>Like an iPhone, the device belongs to the customer, and they&#8217;d have to explicitly install apps from an app store. The result is, developers can easily charge money for the app in a way that agrees with how people pay for things. Thanks Apple AppStore, for training the mass consumers!</p>

<p>A side effect is, since you&#8217;re now selling your app, you no longer need to sell your users: Hey, your product has no ads.</p>

<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>There once was a social network idea pitched to me: an anti-Facebook.</p>

<p>With superb privacy configs, access controls so anal that the infrastructure requires each user to store content in their own harddisk (Ha!). No big brother. No subpoena. I told my peers they&#8217;re crazy.</p>

<p>Perhaps they&#8217;d just needed a better go to market strategy.</p>
