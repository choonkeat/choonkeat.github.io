<meta name="description" content="The Joneses is an interesting idea: if you push product placements all the way to 11, you&#39;d have it done in real life. But how do you attribute a [growth in] sale of product P, to the &quot;Joneses&quot; team member? Target market of product P + geography of the sale? And what if the network effects is far reaching and has no geographical boundary (i.e. internet)? So, no two &quot;Joneses&quot; teams should pimp the same product? No good. What if we try something more pre-emptive, using something more direct - FOAF. So when customer Charlie buys Product P, your CRM picks up that amongst other customers who bought P, customer Betty is in Charlie&#39;s FOAF network&#0160;(Facebook, Twitter, email, blog, flickr, etc). With this knowledge, you could directly credit Betty a referral reward and hope to gain an army of MLM team. But this risks displacing Betty&#39;s original reason of buying your product with a weaker, extrinsic motivation. Alternatively, you could credit Betty with a discount on her next purchase. This approach is good and already exist informally. But it is also unsurprisingly inefficient in its current state: the connection happens if you manage to make the sales assistant remember you and they bother to inquire about referrals when serving a new customer. Wouldn&#39;t it be great if a hypothetical &quot;iCashRegister (now with FOAF)&quot; exist to make this more efficient? To cap the potential&#0160;hemorrhage&#0160;of &quot;discount credits&quot; on heavily connected customers, if there are several customers connected to this new customer, they&#39;d only each get a slice of the credits. Also,&#0160;for some business, it might make sense to attribute a referral based on the transaction of the same product. For other businesses, it might make sense to attribute a referral based on purchase recency. So now any customer connected to a subsequent customer gets discount credits. And&#0160;all this can happen regardless of whether&#0160;(you)&#0160;the business owner is servicing the customer, or if it was just your part-time sales assistant in the shop.
