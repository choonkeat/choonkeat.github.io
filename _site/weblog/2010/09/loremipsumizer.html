Using those screenshots, the other party could have a better feel of things, we could have a clearer discussion.

After installing it, I can anonymize any webpage instantly (then take a screenshot, annotate or print &amp; discuss with somebody else, without worrying about the sensitivity of content) Click here to try it on this webpage! The Loremipsumizer will anonymize all text, scramble all numbers, replace images, flash embeds (&amp; video tags?) with wireframe-ish cross-boxes (via data uri). Unfortunately I didn&#39;t have an elegant solution to anonymize background images (css sprinting, image size, etc) so I&#39;ll need suggestions there. In any case, here are a few screenshots of webpages I&#39;ve anonymized. No prizes for guessing which websites: &lt;/param&gt; &lt;/param&gt; &lt;/param&gt;&lt;/embed&gt; Note: Loremipsumizer does not require any JS library, and have not been tested on irritating browsers.
