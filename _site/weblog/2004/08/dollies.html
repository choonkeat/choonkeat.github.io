<meta name="description" content="Managed to catch &quot;The Revenge of the Dim Sum Dollies&quot; last weekend... I must say, the white cabbage (ask Glen Ong!) is really funny.. especially liked the mat-rock-mix song, Parking Pontianah (depicting the woes of the URA parking attendant, aka Aunty Lilly).. thoroughly hillarious! At some point in the show, I almost couldn&#39;t catch my own breath.. darn good one Selina!&quot;You call me the Parking Pontianah.. you curse me loud-ly.. you curse me loud-ly.. uh uh! You call me the Parking Pontianah.. I do my job proud-ly, I do my job proud-ly, uh uh!&quot; However, I must say I&#39;m much dismayed with the CD purchased. The funniest part of the whole show were the stand-up jokes, between acts, etc.. unfortunately the CD only featured studio recorded songs.. boo hoo. I would&#39;ve better desired a live recording that includes everything - including laughs from the crowd.. oh well! Dollies dollies.. saw another VCD too.. took away only 1 quote with me.. &quot;Bye.. And remember, don&#39;t step on the dolls if you see them.&quot; - a little Afghan girl (Kandahar, 2001) after her lesson learnt in anti-personnel mines." />
