Today I woke at 12:45pm.. read the papers, Recruit section too.. lunch with my mom and built my STIKFAS dragon and watched Discovery channel - which coincidentally Love is gonna be working at, yea! - and hang out with my friends, get suckered into playing mahjong because there-ain&#39;t-a-lot-else-to-do-in-their-house and lost some money... ya, life sure seem back to the way it was.Mental note: I must stop being suckered to mahjong in the future. I appreciate the game, more fun than Big2.. but I know I&#39;ll definitely lose money. So, gambling is unarguably out.Anyways, printed and read an article written by Paul Graham recommended by my sinseh, Don&#39;t be put off by the title. It&#39;s not just about programmers, languages, etc.It broaches on many subjects which make my heart string resonate. Enjoy!It really is an excellent read and how much I wish more people gets the message! .. -sigh-. Btw, time to intro my sinseh.. Though he doesn&#39;t like me addressing him as sinseh but that&#39;s the way its gonna be. Cheewai. I think he&#39;s quite an extraordinaire.. first of all, he was willing to spend time inspiring a total stranger, ignorant idiot like me what the hacker world is.. he was the person that taught me what a :-) smiley is - Woah! Next, he completes his masters in UK and dashes to Botswana to help setup their IT infrastructure.. went to UN.. and now back at Botswana. What a kewl dude!The next inspiration has to go to The Guan.. whom would entertain many of my out-of-classroom can-i-do-this queries with, &quot;in theory, everything can be done&quot; and promptly showed me the prowers of unix. At a time when its fashionable to be I-don&#39;t-give-grades-a-hoot.. he inspired the programmer in us to not just achieve.. but to out-do ourselves and each other.. and achieve &quot;elegance in code&quot;. Its a pity they don&#39;t teach Lisp anymore. car car cdr cdr, cdr cdr car.. Mental note: Curiosity - Thou shalt not lose the spirit to ask, inquire and be the dumb one." />
