Maintenance!&quot; irks the programmer. But this is when the project values him most - experience to gauge the feasibility of each change request, understand the implicit changes required, raise dependency warnings.

But rather, implement a system whereby riches can be distributed to the employees in forms of company golds. Much like the golds your avatar possess in the game.. or more closely, like CPF in the real world. The money (dollar for dollar) is yours but you can&#39;t have them liquidated.
