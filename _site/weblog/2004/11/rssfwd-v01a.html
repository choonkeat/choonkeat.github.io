<meta name="description" content="I&#39;ve been using popheadlines by Graeme (good stuff!) for fetching my RSS feeds. What I like is being able to use my email client - all existing goodie features that comes with it - immediately.However, since configuration is at the email client (I configured mine at work) I feel a sense of lost whenever I&#39;m elsewhere, e.g. at home during weekends or holidays. I&#39;ve always wanted to continue all my feeds at home, or elsewhere... and to be fair, it isn&#39;t a lot of settings to copy... but just knowing that I&#39;m going to repeat my configurations in multiple places, without a way of synchronizing, irks me. A lot.Anyhoos, to scratch my itch, I wrote a simple RSS-polling script in Perl (oh, still my favourite quickie language despite my recent Ruby fling) using XML::RSS::Parser and a few other stuffs. From the TODO list, there&#39;s provision for anyone to subscribe to any RSS-feed via the web.. so will see how it goes.Source code for v0.1a available here [update: all downloads are here]. Feel free to criticise my sloppy code." />
