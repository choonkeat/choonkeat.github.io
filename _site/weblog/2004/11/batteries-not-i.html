Install is not enough? I need a something else (db) installed and configured before this thing runs??So, I embark on a (personal?) journey to pick the lightest, appropriate solution to act as the app server&#39;s internal datastore - separate from the datastore that the application developers will be using. The aim is to magically remove dependency of a database (perception) but still continue to operate as-per-normal.First I found Cloudscape and IBM&#39;s big-fan-fare release of Derby.. then HSQLDB starts propping up from under the carpet (eh, its inside my JBoss directory.. didn&#39;t know that).. then I&#39;m greatly humbled and eternally grateful for this article, &quot;Talk on Open Source Databases&quot;. Anyone shopping for a DB should look through the slides." />
