<meta name="description" content="I&#39;m not sure if this was already out there somewhere. But I sure didn&#39;t find it. Anyways, my very slow (0.3GHZ) machine was coughing all the way whilst I&#39;m trying to write some Java program at home, compiling them with Ant. Frustrated with the start-up delays, I wrote this very simple task to allow invoking of ant targets at will - without the slow startup that Ant has, everytime its called - CommandLineTask.javaTo use, just add a new task definition into an existing build.xml: &lt;taskdef name=&quot;command&quot; classname=&quot;org.yanime.ant.CommandLineTask&quot; /&gt; And add a new target, say &quot;cmd&quot;: &lt;target name=&quot;cmd&quot;&gt; &lt;command /&gt;&lt;/target&gt; Easy. Now, run your build, invoking the &quot;cmd&quot; target and you&#39;ll get a prompt. Type in any targetname to continue / repeat your process. The command line will remain until you type !. With so much speed up (22secs compile now takes 3 seconds!) for so little work (96 lines), I really wonder why I&#39;d never written this helper earlier. Sigh.The only caveat is, don&#39;t use it if any classes used by Ant is being changed and needs a refresh (e.g. whilst developing CommandLineTask which is part of the taskdef in the build.xml) - but that&#39;s pretty rare.Update: Ok, looks like a decent sized compile eats over 100MB of RAM and that remains used, no matter how many times you recompile. So a best-of-both-world solution will be to exit ANT after every input commandline, but restart ANT to the command task&#39;s prompt immediately so that the next compile / commandline can start immediately without waiting for ANT&#39;s slow startup - parsing build.xml. At least that seems to improve my edit-compile-test cycle using Ant." />
