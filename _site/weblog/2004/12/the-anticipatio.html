Not so thrilling afterall.Sidenote: Yet-another-remember-form-fields feature.. why can&#39;t anyone just accept that Gator-spyware really has a good idea and just emulate them instead. Minus the bad intent. Anyways.. I&#39;m probably more caught up with a kewl idea, implemented for Linux as The Dashboard. Excerpt: For example, if a friend IMs you and says &quot;I can&#39;t wait for our camping trip this weekend!&quot; the dashboard will show things like your recent emails about the camping trip, your camping bookmarks, and any files or notes you&#39;ve got on your hard drive about camping.[screenshot]CRM-ready desktop. Not a bad huh? This concept is so going to make it into the enterprise, by this name or another." />
