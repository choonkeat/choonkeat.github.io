<meta name="description" content="Went up JB to celeb granny&#39;s birthday. Good food.. many kids.. hot weather.. bored and sleepy.. all part and parcel of the yearly celebration. My granny is a cheerful lady. Love couldn&#39;t go with us because there wasn&#39;t enough seats with only 1 car.. think my sis-in-law needed to work (on MayDay, boo hoo) and thus couldn&#39;t spare the car for the trip. Miss her very much. Going to start work at new place on Monday already.. feeling a bit uncertain, jittery.. vulnerable still. And to think that all these wouldn&#39;t even be possible had i actually remembered my NS commitment for this (NOW) 3 weeks?! I&#39;d completely forgotten I&#39;m supposed to be in-camp for 3 weeks since 29th Apr.. and imagine my Ohmigosh reaction when they called me up.. I mean, nobody remembered? Even my ex-company whom I&#39;d given them the &quot;Employer&#39;s copy&quot;.. if my personal time-table is screwed.. the company is even more so. Anyways.. I must get my iCal/vCal or whatever calendar standard up and running on this server.. I&#39;ll have fail-proof reminder from now on.. haha! I can even host my sec school&#39;s long-awaited eCircles-like portal.. but diskspace is a problem.. for the amount I&#39;m paying, I get 200MB only.. and for USD 20 more a month.. I&#39;ll actually get 5GB.. go figure. I must find my Aloy friend now.. perhaps he&#39;s interested in setting more things up here.. and probably setup something like Jabber too.. I&#39;m 1k in-debt again.. ARGH!" />
