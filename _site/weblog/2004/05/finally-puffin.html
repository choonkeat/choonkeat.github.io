<meta name="description" content="Good to hear that my bestest friend is going to launch a free, desktop searching tool code-named Puffin. In fact, I was just lamenting to my friend that searching the entire web is faster than looking for stuffs in on my harddisk.. which is least to say, a very pathetic and ironic state of affairs. In fact, BlackMagic recently caught my eye and seems impressive.. looks like a potential filler before Longhorn.. but now, we&#39;re gonna have Puffin too :-) What BlackMagic has, in addition, is version control.. Kewl. Version control all your files in a particular drive.. easily search them too.. the non-IT saavy folks could at last use &quot;CVS&quot; with full integration to their desktop, plus ability to search - fast! -.. these to me, is the holy grail of desktop computing indeed. For what&#39;s the computer desktop for, if it doesn&#39;t increase your productivity??? Google has reinvented the email by using (their) search technology and challenging current norms (disk space, mail folders, delete mails). E-mailing has indeed changed since I used Gmail.. there&#39;s only 3 things to do after reading a mail, archive it, mark as spam, reply to it. No more folders.. put where.. delete la.. i don&#39;t need it.. do i need it?.. Archive! Simple change of mindset, a revolution not to be under-estimated. Changing the little things can sometimes start an epidemic.. (i&#39;m reading Tipping Point) Anyways.. I hope they&#39;ll reinvent something this time too. Surprise me, pleasantly." />
