Hmm, i should get moblog feature up soon.. and perhaps get a camera phone while i&#39;m at it.. and perhaps change my phone subscription to StarHub too...Anyways, was havin dinner with Love and she gave me a lovers-ultimatum (yet again). This time the test for our Hero was to recognize the tasty, black, ring thingies you see at the frontmost of this plate of left-over pizza (Sorry folks, forgot to rotate this pic before uploadin.. gotta tilt ur head to the right)Anyways.. silly me went on to guess.. of all things?.... Anchovies?!? How would I know that&#39;s fancy angmor for plain-old gang-he-kia? All I knew was that I heard Michaelangelo mentions it a lot :-( Guess I should&#39;ve learn how to cook then.. And to make matters worse.. a second ultimatum floored our Hero as well! What fruit juice has orangey sourness.. peachy pale color.. How could anyone have guessed grape-fruit? -doh!- ... And that&#39;s how &quot;we decided&quot; to embark on our a-fruit-a-week tutorials so that Hero can learn of all the fruity goodies.. Anyways.. hungry now and going off for dinner soon. -Yum yum-" />
